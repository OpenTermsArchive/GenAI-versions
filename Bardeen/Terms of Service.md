Terms of Service
================

_Last Update: May 27, 2023_

Please read these Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”) and our Privacy Policy ([https://www.bardeen.ai/privacy-policy](https://www.bardeen.ai/privacy-policy)) (“**Privacy Policy**”) carefully because they govern your use of the website located at [https://www.bardeen.ai/](https://www.bardeen.ai/) (the “**Site**”), Bardeen’s browser extension (“**Extension**”), and Bardeen’s automation and productivity tools, applications, and all other products and services offered by Bardeen (“**Bardeen**”). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, Extension, and our tools, applications and services are collectively called the “**Services**.”

**IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR U.S. CUSTOMERS: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND Bardeen THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 15 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.**

**1\. Agreement to Terms.**  
By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services.  
  
**2\. Privacy Policy.**  
Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Services, for information on how we collect, use and share your information.  
  
**3\. Changes to these Terms or the Services.**  
We may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site and/or may also send other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.  
  
**4\. Who May Use the Services?  
‍**You may use the Services only if you are at least 13 years of age (or such other minimum age at which you can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your territory), and not otherwise barred from using the Services under applicable law. You also agree that you will not use the Services in connection with your professional endeavors (e.g., in connection with your work or employment) unless you have received express permission to do so.  For certain features of the Services you’ll need an account. It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and current account information and keep this information up to date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your account. To protect your account, keep the account details and password confidential, and notify us right away of any unauthorized use. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your account.    
  
**5\. Feedback.**  
We appreciate feedback, comments, ideas, proposals and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“**Feedback**”). If you choose to submit Feedback, you agree that we are free to use it without any restriction or compensation to you.  
  
**6\. Payments and Subscriptions.**  
Bardeen requires payment of a fee for use of the Services (or certain portions thereof) and you agree to pay such fees. You may make a one-time payment for specific aspects or features of the Services (“**One-Time Payment**”), and you may purchase a monthly or annual subscription (“**Subscription**”) for your use of the Services.

1. **General.**  
    Whether you make a One-Time Payment or purchase a Subscription (each, a “**Transaction**”), you expressly authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge you for such Transaction. We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your email and postal addresses for billing and notification (such information, “**Payment Information**”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a Transaction, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to third parties so we can complete your Transaction and to charge your payment method for the type of Transaction you have selected (plus any applicable taxes and other charges). You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information). By initiating a Transaction, you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies applicable to such fees and charges, as posted or otherwise communicated to you. All payments for Transactions are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms. All fees and applicable taxes, if any, are payable in United States dollars.
    
2. **Refunds.**  
    All sales are final. But if for any reason you're unhappy with Bardeen, please let us know at [support@bardeen.ai](mailto:support@bardeen.ai) — we'd love to hear your feedback, and will be happy to work with you to help create the best experience possible. Bardeen may consider refund requests on a case-by-case basis, and decisions on whether to grant a refund request are in the sole discretion of Bardeen.
    
3. **Cancelling One-Time Payment or Subscription.**  
    If something unexpected happens in the course of completing a Transaction, we reserve the right to cancel your Transaction for any reason; if we cancel your Transaction we’ll refund any payment you have already remitted to us for such Transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, you may cancel your Subscription at any time, but please note that such cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. You may cancel your Subscription via the functionality of the Services. You will be responsible for all Subscription Fees (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) incurred for the then-current Subscription period. If you cancel, your right to use the Services will continue until the end of your then current Subscription period and will then terminate without further charges.
    

**7\. Content.**

1. **Posting Content.**  
    Our Services may allow you to import, store or submit content such as text, files, documents, graphics, images, automations, models, and other software code. Anything (other than Feedback) that you make available through the Services is referred to as “**User Content**”. Bardeen does not claim any ownership rights in any User Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to your User Content.
    
2. **Permissions to Your User Content.**  
    By making any User Content available through the Services you hereby grant to Bardeen a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly display, and publicly perform your User Content in connection with operating, improving (including for training, optimizing, and developing), and providing the Services and any other Bardeen products or services.
    
3. **Your Responsibility for User Content.**  
    You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you have (and will have) all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Services, nor any use of your User Content by Bardeen on or through the Services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.
    
4. **Removal of User Content.  
    ‍**You can remove your User Content by specifically deleting it via the functionality of the Services. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User Content.
    
5. **Generative Artificial Intelligence Features.**  
    Certain features of the Services utilize generative artificial intelligence, including without limitation to generate custom automations based on a prompt, automation, or other data or input provided by you (each, a “**Prompt**”), or based on any derived or aggregated from any usage data or trends with respect to your use of the Services (that, for clarity, does not include any personal information). Each such Prompt you provide to the Services may result in a generative automation based on your Prompt which endeavors to implement the specifications of your Prompt in the Services (each, a “**Generative Automation**”). As between you and Bardeen, the Prompt constitutes your User Content and remains fully owned by you. So long as you remain in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Bardeen grants you a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to the Generative Automation, solely in connection with your use of Bardeen’s Services. You acknowledge and agree that (1) the Generative Automations may not be unique and the Services may generate the same or similar output for other parties utilizing the generative artificial intelligence features, and (2) use of the generative artificial intelligence features of the Services may result in Generative Automations that do not meet the requirements of your Prompt. You should evaluate the accuracy of any Generative Automations as appropriate for your use case, and you will remain solely responsible for and assume all risk in connection with your use of such Generative Automations. You further acknowledge that certain Generative Automations (such as those associated with premium features or automations of the Services) may require a fee to operate, and you agree to pay such fee in connection with the operation of such Generative Automation.
    
6. **Bardeen’s Intellectual Property.**  
    We may make available through the Services content that is subject to intellectual property rights. We retain all rights to that content and to the Generative Automations.
    
7. **Abuse of the product.  
    ‍**Please be aware that the excessive or abusive use of extensions, bots, or automation tools on some websites can lead to penalties, including temporary or even permanent restrictions on your account.

3. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN Bardeen AND YOU.
    

**14\. Governing Law and Forum Choice.**  
‍  
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 15 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Bardeen are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, CA, and you and Bardeen each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.  
  
**15\. Dispute Resolution.**

1. **Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.**  
    We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “**Disputes**”) will be resolved **solely** **by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding**. You and Bardeen agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Bardeen are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
    
2. **Exceptions.**  
    As limited exceptions to Section 15(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
    
3. **Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.**  
    The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “**AAA Rules**”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175). Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
    
4. **Arbitration Costs.  
    **Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
    
5. **Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.  
    **Except as provided in Section 15(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
    
6. **Class Action Waiver.  
      
    YOU AND Bardeen AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  
      
    **Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
    
7. **Severability.  
    **With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 15(f) of these Terms (“**Class Action Waiver**”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.
    

**16\. General Terms.**

1. **Reservation of Rights.  
    **Bardeen and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.
    
2. **Entire Agreement.  
    **These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Bardeen and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Bardeen and you regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Bardeen’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Bardeen may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
    
3. **Notices.  
    **Any notices or other communications provided by Bardeen under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services or our website. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
    
4. **Waiver of Rights.  
    **Bardeen’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Bardeen. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
