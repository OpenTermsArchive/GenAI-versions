When registering to the Service, and at any time during the term of the Agreement, you must provide true, accurate and complete information as required by Berget, and keep your information up-to-date. If you provide inaccurate, incomplete or fraudulent information, we have the right to suspend and/or terminate your access to and use of the Service in accordance with Section 13 below.

We reserve the right to limit or restrict your ability to place Orders.

4.3. You will be liable for all activities conducted in the Service under your Account, including any actions taken by the Users.

5\. Right to Access the Service

5.2. You are allowed to utilise the Service in the provision of your own services to your End-Customers. However, you remain fully liable to us for any actions your End-Customers take in, and for the content they upload to, the Service. Under no circumstances will Berget have any liability to your End-Customers.

6\. Provision of the Service, Service Levels, Warranties & Security
-------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1. We will perform the Service in accordance with these Terms with commercially reasonable care and skill and in all material respects as described in the Service Descriptions.

6.2. If you consider that the Service provided to you was not performed as described in the relevant Service Description, you must promptly provide us with a written notice that describes the deficiency in the Service.

In all other respects the Service is provided on “as-is” and “as-available” basis, and Berget will not give the Customer any warranty or guarantee, express or implied, for the Service, its merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, performance, or non-infringement. The Service is not designed to be error-free or uninterrupted and therefore it is neither intended nor fit for purposes that require fail-safe performance. The remedies set forth in this Section 6 will be your sole and exclusive remedies for any defects, deficiencies or interruptions in the Service.

6.6 Berget maintains commercially reasonable business continuity and disaster recovery measures designed to restore the availability of the Service in the event of an incident. While Berget does not guarantee uninterrupted service, we implement redundant infrastructure and regular data backups for core systems, excluding Customer Data unless otherwise agreed in writing.

6.7 Berget applies industry-standard technical and organizational measures to secure its infrastructure, including encryption in transit, network isolation, access controls, and system monitoring. Berget is actively working toward ISO 27001 certification to formalize its information security management system. More information about our security practices is available upon request.

7\. Data Retention

For the provisioning of services as well as improving our service offering, optimize our performance and charge correctly for our service - we might collect data such as

* Detailed service logs
* API request metadata (HTTP Calls, status codes, time stamps)
* Compute resource token counts
* Inference token input and output counts for LLMs
* User defined parameters

For the avoidance of doubt - Berget will never store any of the actual prompt content used as model input, or any of the output content generated by the LLMs we host.

We will provide technical support for your dedicated administrative users.

Support access channels are depending on your monthly plan and we provide support through the following channels

We do not assume any liability with regard to Third-Party Products or their use, whether or not they are linked to the Service.

12\. Payment Terms and Service Credits

The Credits are non-refundable and non-transferable unless otherwise decided by Berget at its sole discretion. Through your Account, you can download invoices for the Credits you have purchased.

If your Credit balance runs out (zero or negative balance), we have the right to suspend your use of the Service. If you do not remedy the negative or zero balance and deposit Credits to your Account within a reasonable time determined by Berget (at a minimum fourteen (14) days), we will consider the Agreement terminated and will close your Account.

Unless otherwise required by law, we will retain your Customer Data for a period of thirty (30) days following termination to allow for data export or recovery. After this period, Customer Data will be irreversibly deleted, unless longer retention is required by applicable law or Governmental Authority. You are obliged to pay applicable service fees (e.g. for storage and IP addresses) even during the suspension until the Agreement is terminated.

13\. Free Trials
----------------

13.1. We may from time to time offer trials of the Service for a specified period without payment obligation by offering you free-of-charge Credits or by way of a money-back guarantee (“Free Trial”). The features of the Service may be limited during the Free Trial. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to determine the Customer’s eligibility for a Free Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or modify a Free Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.

13.2. We may require you to provide payment details to start the Free Trial. After the expiry of the Free Trial, we have the right to start charging for the Service the applicable service fees in accordance with Section 11 above and according to the currently valid public price list.

You grant Berget the right to host, use, process, display and transmit Customer Data to provide the Service in accordance with the Agreement. You have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of Customer Data, and for obtaining necessary rights and consents related to Customer Data to allow Berget to perform the Service. If you do not have necessary rights or consents related to the Customer Data, you are not allowed to upload or store such Customer Data in the Service.

18\. Confidentiality
--------------------

18.1. The Parties may exchange Confidential Information during the performance of the Agreement. “Confidential Information” means any non-public information which is marked as confidential or which should be understood as confidential, irrespective of its form of storage or disclosure, including in particular Customer Data. Any information of or relating to a Party or that Party’s Affiliates, personnel, suppliers, contractors, customers or end-users, which information is obtained or detected by the other Party or processed or generated in the course of providing or receiving the Service shall be deemed Confidential Information of that Party.

18.2. All Confidential Information shall remain the property of the disclosing Party, and the receiving Party shall keep it confidential and refrain from using it otherwise than for the purposes of the Agreement. The Parties shall limit access to the Confidential Information within their organisations to only those Affiliates, employees, directors, officers, agents, and advisors (including attorneys, accountants, and consultants) (collectively, “Associates”) who need to access the Confidential Information for the purposes of the Agreement. The receiving Party shall ensure that its Associates are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those set forth herein before disclosing any Confidential Information.

18.3. The confidentiality obligations herein shall not apply to Confidential Information which:

Unless prohibited by law or an order of Governmental Authority, the receiving Party shall take reasonable steps to notify the disclosing Party of such disclosure request or order.

18.5. Each Party shall promptly upon termination of the Agreement cease using Confidential Information of the other Party and use reasonable means to destroy such Confidential Information. Each Party shall, however, be entitled to retain the copies of Confidential Information which: (i) the Party is required to retain by applicable laws; and (ii) are generated pursuant to the receiving Party’s electronic backup system if destroying such copies would be unreasonable taking into account the costs and effort required to do so.

You have the right to terminate the Agreement for any reason by issuing at least five (5) days’ written notice to us and we have the right to terminate the Agreement for any reason by issuing at least 30 (thirty) days’ written notice to you.

26.2. All amendments to the Agreement must be made in writing. We have the right to modify these Terms by posting a revised version of the Terms on Berget’s website. If we consider the revision to be material, we will notify you in writing at least 30 (thirty) days before the revision will be effected and reserve you a possibility to terminate the Agreement, unless the revision is implemented due to changes in legislation, in which case we may effect it without an advance notice. If you continue using the Service, you will be deemed to have accepted the revised Terms as part of the Agreement.

27\. Non-Waiver
---------------

A failure by either Party to enforce any provision of the Agreement will not be deemed to constitute a present or future waiver of such provision. All waivers must be made in writing.

28.2. The Customer’s obligations towards Berget and the provisions regarding Berget’s limitations of liability are in place also for the benefit of Berget’s Affiliates, subcontractors, personnel and owners. Otherwise the Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any third party.

-----------------

If any provision of the Agreement is ruled unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.
