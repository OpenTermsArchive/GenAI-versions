Usage policies
==============

_We’ve updated our usage policies to be more readable and added service-specific guidance. Customers may sign up to receive notifications of new updates to our usage policies by filling out_ [_this form_⁠](https://share.hsforms.com/11ElWDMppRveok1ZzEMFmiQ4sk30)_._

We aim for our tools to be used safely and responsibly, while maximizing your control over how you use them. By using our services, you agree to adhere to our policies.

We have established universal policies applicable to all our services, as well as specific policies for builders who use ChatGPT or our API to create applications for themselves or others. Violating our policies could result in action against your account, up to suspension or termination. We also work to make our models safer and more useful, by training them to refuse harmful instructions and reduce their tendency to produce harmful content.

We believe that learning from real-world use is a critical component of creating and releasing increasingly safe AI systems. We cannot predict all beneficial or abusive uses of our technology, so we proactively monitor for new abuse trends. Our policies will evolve based on what we learn over time.

Universal policies
------------------

To maximize innovation and creativity, we believe you should have the flexibility to use our services as you see fit, so long as you comply with the law and don’t harm yourself or others. When using any OpenAI service, like ChatGPT, labs.openai.com, and the OpenAI API, these rules apply:

1. **Comply with applicable laws**—for example, do not:
    1. Compromise the privacy of others
    2. Engage in regulated activity without complying with applicable regulations
    3. Promote or engage in any illegal activity, including the exploitation or harm of children and the development or distribution of illegal substances, goods, or services
    4. Use subliminal, manipulative, or deceptive techniques that distort a person’s behavior so that they are unable to make informed decisions in a way that is likely to cause harm
    5. Exploit any vulnerabilities related to age, disability, or socio-economic circumstances
    6. Create or expand facial recognition databases without consent
    7. Conduct real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces for law enforcement purposes
    8. Evaluate or classify individuals based on their social behavior or personal traits (including social scoring or predictive profiling) leading to detrimental or unfavorable treatment
    9. Assess or predict the risk of an individual committing a criminal offense based solely on their personal traits or on profiling
    10. Infer an individual’s emotions in the workplace and educational settings, except when necessary for medical or safety reasons
    11. Categorize individuals based on their biometric data to deduce or infer sensitive attributes such as their race, political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation.
2. **Don’t use our service to harm yourself or others**—for example, don’t use our services to promote suicide or self-harm, develop or use weapons, injure others or destroy property, or engage in unauthorized activities that violate the security of any service or system.
3. **Don’t repurpose or distribute output from our services to harm others**—for example, don’t share output from our services to defraud, scam, spam, mislead, bully, harass, defame, discriminate based on protected attributes, sexualize children, or promote violence, hatred or the suffering of others.
4. **Respect our safeguards**—don’t circumvent safeguards or safety mitigations in our services unless supported by OpenAI (e.g., domain experts in our Red Teaming Network)⁠ or related to research conducted in accordance with our Sharing & Publication Policy⁠.

We report apparent child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

Building with the OpenAI API Platform
-------------------------------------

The OpenAI Platform allows you to build entirely custom applications. As the developer of your application, you are responsible for designing and implementing how your users interact with our technology. To make this easier, we’ve shared our [Safety best practices⁠](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices), and offer tools like our [Moderation Endpoint⁠⁠](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation) and customizable system messages.

We recognize that our API introduces new capabilities with scalable impact, so we have service-specific policies that apply to all use of our APIs in addition to our Universal Policies:

1. Don’t compromise the privacy of others, including:
    1. Collecting, processing, disclosing, inferring or generating personal data without complying with applicable legal requirements
    2. Using biometric systems for identification or assessment, including facial recognition
    3. Facilitating spyware, communications surveillance, or unauthorized monitoring of individuals
2. Don’t perform or facilitate the following activities that may significantly impair the safety, wellbeing, or rights of others, including:
    1. Providing tailored legal, medical/health, or financial advice without review by a qualified professional and disclosure of the use of AI assistance and its potential limitations
    2. Making high-stakes automated decisions in domains that affect an individual’s safety, rights or well-being (e.g., law enforcement, migration, management of critical infrastructure, safety components of products, essential services, credit, employment, housing, education, social scoring, or insurance)
    3. Facilitating real money gambling or payday lending
    4. Engaging in political campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted at specific demographics
    5. Deterring people from participation in democratic processes, including misrepresenting voting processes or qualifications and discouraging voting
3. Don’t misuse our platform to cause harm by intentionally deceiving or misleading others, including
    1. Generating or promoting disinformation, misinformation, or false online engagement (e.g., comments, reviews)
    2. Impersonating another individual or organization without consent or legal right
    3. Engaging in or promoting academic dishonesty
    4. Failing to ensure that automated systems (e.g., chatbots) disclose to people that they are interacting with AI, unless it's obvious from the context
4. Don’t build tools that may be inappropriate for minors, including:
    1. Sexually explicit or suggestive content. This does not include content created for scientific or educational purposes.

Building with ChatGPT
---------------------

Shared GPTs allow you to use ChatGPT to build experiences for others. Because your GPT’s users are also OpenAI users, when building with ChatGPT, we have the following service-specific policies in addition to our Universal Policies:

1. Don’t compromise the privacy of others, including:
    1. Collecting, processing, disclosing, inferring or generating personal data without complying with applicable legal requirements
    2. Soliciting or collecting the following sensitive identifiers, security information, or their equivalents: payment card information (e.g. credit card numbers or bank account information), government identifiers (e.g. SSNs), API keys, or passwords
    3. Using biometric identification systems for identification or assessment, including facial recognition
    4. Facilitating spyware, communications surveillance, or unauthorized monitoring of individuals
2. Don’t perform or facilitate the following activities that may significantly affect the safety, wellbeing, or rights of others, including:
    1. Taking unauthorized actions on behalf of users
    2. Providing tailored legal, medical/health, or financial advice
    3. Making automated decisions in domains that affect an individual’s rights or well-being (e.g., law enforcement, migration, management of critical infrastructure, safety components of products, essential services, credit, employment, housing, education, social scoring, or insurance)
    4. Facilitating real money gambling or payday lending
    5. Engaging in political campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted at specific demographics
    6. Deterring people from participation in democratic processes, including misrepresenting voting processes or qualifications and discouraging voting
3. Don’t misinform, misrepresent, or mislead others, including:
    1. Generating or promoting disinformation, misinformation, or false online engagement (e.g., comments, reviews)
    2. Impersonating another individual or organization without consent or legal right
    3. Engaging in or promoting academic dishonesty
    4. Using content from third parties without the necessary permissions
    5. Misrepresenting or misleading others about the purpose of your GPT
4. Don’t build tools that may be inappropriate for minors, including:
    1. Sexually explicit or suggestive content. This does not include content created for scientific or educational purposes.
5. Don’t build tools that target users under 13 years of age.

We use a combination of automated systems, human review, and user reports to find and assess GPTs that potentially violate our policies. Violations can lead to actions against the content or your account, such as warnings, sharing restrictions, or ineligibility for inclusion in GPT Store or monetization.

GPT store
---------

We want to make sure that GPTs in the GPT Store are appropriate for all users. For example, GPTs that contain profanity in their names or that depict or promote graphic violence are not allowed in our Store. We also don’t allow GPTs dedicated to fostering romantic companionship or performing regulated activities.

These policies may be enforced automatically at submission time or applied retroactively upon further review.

Last updated: July 22, 2025

Creating images and videos in line with our policies
====================================================

Below are some tips on how to respect our image and video generation guardrails and help ensure that all usage complies with OpenAI’s Usage Policies.

1\. Compliance with OpenAI’s Usage Policies
-------------------------------------------

All ChatGPT and Sora users have agreed to OpenAI’s Usage Policies, Service Terms, and Terms of Use. These policies apply universally to OpenAI services and are designed to ensure safe and responsible usage of AI technology. You can review OpenAI’s Usage Policies [here⁠](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/).

#### 1.1 Depictions of Real People

You may not edit images or videos that depict any real individual without their explicit consent. You may not create images or videos as means to impersonate, harass, intimidate, or otherwise harm the depicted individual or perpetrate fraud against others.

4o image generation is capable in many instances of generating depictions of a public figure based on a text prompt. Public figures who wish for their depiction not to be generated can let us know through [this form⁠](https://openai.com/form/report-content/).

#### 1.2 Inappropriate and Harmful Content

ChatGPT and Sora users are prohibited from creating or distributing content that promotes or causes harm. This includes content that is generated to harass, defame, promote violence, or sexualize children. Examples include, but are not limited to:

* Non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII)
* Content promoting suicide, self-harm or disordered eating
* Content glorifying terrorism or terrorist organizations
* Targeted harassment and bullying content
* Age-inappropriate content distributed to minors

#### 1.3 Misleading Content

Our policies prohibit any use of our image or video tools to create or distribute content that is used to defraud, scam, or mislead others. This includes taking steps to obscure or hide the use of AI technology in the image and video generation process.

#### 1.4 Avoid illegal content or content that may violate intellectual property rights

OpenAI’s Terms of Use prohibit any content that may violate the law—including using the intellectual property of others in ways that violate their rights.

2\. The Sora Feed
-----------------

In addition to the usage and content generation policies above, we also take steps to ensure the Sora feed is appropriate and enjoyable to broad audiences, including removing content from the feed that features:

* Realistic graphic violence or sexual acts
* Extremely offensive language or content glorifying hatred or depression
* Encouraging dangerous stunts or challenges likely to result in serious injury
* Stigmatization of body types
* Actively encouraging the use of a harmful drug or substance

3. Reporting Violations
-----------------------

If you encounter content that you believe violates any of our policies, [please report it immediately⁠](https://openai.com/form/report-content/). We take all violations seriously and will review reported content for compliance with our terms and the broader OpenAI Usage Policies.

Updated: November 14, 2022

Sharing & publication policy
============================

Social media, livestreaming, and demonstrations
-----------------------------------------------

To mitigate the possible risks of AI-generated content, we have set the following policy on permitted sharing.

Posting your own prompts or completions to social media is generally permissible, as is livestreaming your usage or demonstrating our products to groups of people. Please adhere to the following:

* Manually review each generation before sharing or while streaming.
* Attribute the content to your name or your company.
* Indicate that the content is AI-generated in a way no user could reasonably miss or misunderstand.
* Do not share content that violates our [Content Policy⁠](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/) or that may offend others.
* If taking audience requests for prompts, use good judgment; do not input prompts that might result in violations of our [Content Policy⁠](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/).

If you would like to ensure the OpenAI team is aware of a particular completion, you may email us or use the reporting tools within Playground.

* Recall that you are interacting with the raw model, which means we do not filter out biased or negative responses. (Also, you can read more about implementing our [free Moderation endpoint⁠](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/moderation) here.)

Content co-authored with the OpenAI API
---------------------------------------

Creators who wish to publish their first-party written content (e.g., a book, compendium of short stories) created in part with the OpenAI API are permitted to do so under the following conditions:

* The published content is attributed to your name or company.
* The role of AI in formulating the content is clearly disclosed in a way that no reader could possibly miss, and that a typical reader would find sufficiently easy to understand.
* Topics of the content do not violate OpenAI’s [Content Policy⁠](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/) or [Terms of Use⁠](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/), e.g., are not related to adult content, spam, hateful content, content that incites violence, or other uses that may cause social harm.
* We kindly ask that you refrain from sharing outputs that may offend others.

For instance, one must detail in a Foreword or Introduction (or some place similar) the relative roles of drafting, editing, etc. People should not represent API-generated content as being wholly generated by a human or wholly generated by an AI, and it is a human who must take ultimate responsibility for the content being published.

Here is some stock language you may use to describe your creative process, provided it is accurate:

> The author generated this text in part with GPT‑3, OpenAI’s large-scale language-generation model. Upon generating draft language, the author reviewed, edited, and revised the language to their own liking and takes ultimate responsibility for the content of this publication.

Research
--------

We believe it is important for the broader world to be able to evaluate our research and products, especially to understand and improve potential weaknesses and safety or bias problems in our models. Accordingly, we welcome research publications related to the OpenAI API.

* In some cases, we may want to highlight your work internally and/or externally.
* In others, such as publications that pertain to security or misuse of the API, we may want to take appropriate actions to protect our users.
* If you notice any safety or security issues with the API in the course of your research, we ask that you please submit these immediately through our [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Program⁠](https://openai.com/policies/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-policy/).

Researcher Access Program
-------------------------

There are a number of research directions we are excited to explore with the OpenAI API. If you are interested in the opportunity for subsidized access, please provide us with details about your research use case on the [Researcher Access Program application⁠](https://openai.com/form/researcher-access-program/).

In particular, we consider the following to be especially important directions, though you are free to craft your own direction:

* **Alignment**: How can we understand what objective, if any, a model is best understood as pursuing? How do we increase the extent to which that objective is aligned with human preferences, such as via prompt design or fine-tuning?
* **Fairness and representation**: How should performance criteria be established for fairness and representation in language models? How can language models be improved in order to effectively support the goals of fairness and representation in specific, deployed contexts?
* **Interdisciplinary research**: How can AI development draw on insights from other disciplines such as philosophy, cognitive science, and sociolinguistics?
* **Interpretability and transparency**: How do these models work, mechanistically? Can we identify what concepts they’re using, or extract latent knowledge from the model, make inferences about the training procedure, or predict surprising future behavior?
* **Misuse potential**: How can systems like the API be misused? What sorts of “red teaming” approaches can we develop to help us and other AI developers think about responsibly deploying technologies like this?
* **Model exploration**: Models like those served by the API have a variety of capabilities which we have yet to explore. We’re excited by investigations in many areas including model limitations, linguistic properties, commonsense reasoning, and potential uses for many other problems.
* **Robustness**: Generative models have uneven capability surfaces, with the potential for surprisingly strong and surprisingly weak areas of capability. How robust are large generative models to “natural” perturbations in the prompt, such as phrasing the same idea in different ways or with or without typos? Can we predict the kinds of domains and tasks for which large generative models are more likely to be robust (or not robust), and how does this relate to the training data? Are there techniques we can use to predict and mitigate worst-case behavior? How can robustness be measured in the context of few-shot learning (e.g., across variations in prompts)? Can we train models so that they satisfy safety properties with a very high level of reliability, even under adversarial inputs?

Please note that due to a high volume of requests, it takes time for us to review these applications and not all research will be prioritized for subsidy. We will only be in touch if your application is selected for subsidy.
