#### General FAQ

### How can I use OpenAI technology in my business?

The easiest way to get started with OpenAI is to deploy ChatGPT Business or ChatGPT Enterprise for your employees. It’s simple to use and allows anyone in your organization to be productive with AI. If your engineering teams wish to build custom solutions using our technology, try our [API Platform⁠⁠](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction)

### Does OpenAI train its models on my business data?

By default, we do not use your business data for training our models. If you have explicitly opted in to share your data with us (for example, through our opt-in [feedback mechanisms⁠](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9883556-sharing-model-feedback-through-the-api)) to improve our services, then we may use the shared data to train our models.

### What if I use GPTs in ChatGPT Enterprise, Business, Teachers, or Edu?

Your end users or workspace members can build and share GPTs internally with each other within your workspace. The same commitments we provide for ChatGPT Enterprise, Business, Teachers, and Edu also apply to your use of GPTs within those workspaces. Note that if your workspace admins enable GPTs to be shareable with the public, any GPTs that your users choose to publish externally may be subject to additional review. Learn more about [GPTs⁠⁠](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts/).

### What if I use connectors in ChatGPT Enterprise, Business, Teachers, or Edu?

Connectors enable ChatGPT to send and retrieve information from connected internal sources and third-party applications, including to help provide more context for its responses. Your workspace admins can control which connectors are enabled for your workspace. ChatGPT respects your organization’s existing permissions, and each end user is required to authenticate with a connected application before use. By default, we do not train our models on any business data accessed from connectors. Learn more about [connectors⁠⁠](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487775)

### Who owns inputs and outputs?

As between you and OpenAI: you retain all rights to the inputs you provide to our services and you own any output you rightfully receive from our services to the extent permitted by law. We only receive rights in input and output necessary to provide you with our services, comply with applicable law, and enforce our policies.

### How does OpenAI ensure data security?

OpenAI encrypts all data at rest (AES-256) and in transit between our customers and us and between us and our service providers (TLS 1.2+), and uses strict access controls to limit who can access data. Our security team has an on-call rotation that has 24/7/365 coverage and is paged in case of any potential security incident. We offer a [Bug Bounty Program⁠⁠](https://openai.com/blog/bug-bounty-program/) for responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities discovered on our platform and products. Please visit our [Trust Portal⁠⁠](https://trust.openai.com/) for more details.

  

### Can OpenAI support my compliance with GDPR and other privacy laws?

Yes, we are able to execute a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) with customers for their use of ChatGPT Business, ChatGPT Enterprise, and the API in support of their compliance with GDPR and other privacy laws. Please complete our [DPA form⁠⁠](https://ironcladapp.com/public-launch/63ffefa2bed6885f4536d0fe) to execute a DPA with OpenAI. For ChatGPT Edu and for Teachers, we process your data pursuant to our [Student Data Privacy Agreement⁠](https://cdn.openai.com/osa/openai-sdpa.pdf).

### Does OpenAI review my business data?

We may run any business data submitted to OpenAI’s services through automated content classifiers and safety tools, including to better understand how our services are used. The classifications created are metadata about the business data but do not contain any of the business data itself. Business data is only subject to human review as described below on a service-by-service basis.
