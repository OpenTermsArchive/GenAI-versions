Connectors and actions terms
============================

1\. Introduction
----------------

Connectors and Actions (together “Connectors”) allow OpenAI services (“Services”) such as ChatGPT to retrieve information from or send instructions to an API (“API”) created according to our Connectors protocol. Users of OpenAI Services can choose to use or enable Connectors within certain Services. For example, a ChatGPT user who wants to make a restaurant reservation could enable a restaurant reservation Connector and instruct ChatGPT to make the reservation.

These Connectors and Actions Terms (“Terms”) govern the creation and use of your Connector in connection with OpenAI Services. If you reside within the European Economic Area or Switzerland, your agreement is with OpenAI Ireland Ltd. These Terms include our [Usage Policies⁠](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/)⁠ and other documentation, guidelines, or policies we may provide in writing or on our website. By creating a Connector or API or by explicitly agreeing to these Terms, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you create a Connector on behalf of another person or entity, you represent that you have the authority to agree to these Terms on their behalf.

2\. Connectors
--------------

(a) **Access.** We may: (i) access and use your API to enable your Connector within the Services; and (ii) allow our users to access and use your Connector to retrieve information or take action on your website or application through the Services. We will not: (i) use your API to modify, translate, or create derivative works of your API; (ii) lease, distribute, pledge, assign, or otherwise transfer rights to your API to any third party; or (iii) intentionally interfere with or disrupt your API or any of its security measures.

(b) **Connector Requests.** The Services will send a request to your API containing information on behalf of a user of the Services (“Connector Request”). If you have entered into a separate agreement with a user to process their information contained in a Connector Request, then the terms of that separate agreement apply. Otherwise, you may only collect, use, store, transmit, and process Connector Requests (i) in accordance with all applicable laws; and (ii) only as necessary to respond to or follow the instructions of the Connector Request or to comply with applicable law. We are not responsible for any content or information from users or other Connectors that is sent to your API.

(c) **Connector Responses.** When your API receives a Connector Request, it will send information or content back to the Services (“Connector Response”). You are responsible for ensuring your Connector Responses and API comply with all applicable laws and our [Usage Policies⁠](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/)⁠. You grant us a worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, copy, translate, display, modify, and distribute all or any part of the Connector Response to enable your Connector to function within the Services. Upon termination of these Terms or if you remove your Connector from the Services, we may continue to use Connector Responses to maintain users’ Service history. You represent and warrant that you have obtained and will maintain all necessary rights (including from your users) to grant us these rights and to operate your Connector.

(d) **Connector Reviews.** While we are not obligated to monitor Connectors or their content, we may at any time: (i) review or test your Connector to ensure quality and compliance with these Terms; or (ii) remove or refuse to display any content that violates these Terms. We may refuse to include any Connector in our Services and may remove any Connector from our Services at any time for any reason. Any information you give to us will be accurate and up-to-date.

(e) **Restrictions.** Your API and Connector Responses will not: (i) pose a security vulnerability or threat to our users, us, or any third party; (ii) interact with our users in a manner that is deceptive, false, misleading, or harassing; (iii) return or contain illegal, defamatory, pornographic, harmful, infringing, or otherwise objectionable content; (iv) include any malware, viruses, surveillance, or other malicious programs or code; (v) interfere with, damage, or access in any unauthorized manner any software, technology or services of ours or any third party; (vi) use Connector Requests to develop models that compete with OpenAI; or (vii) send us any personal information of children under 13 or the applicable age of digital consent.

(f) **Feedback.** If you provide feedback or suggestions on our Connectors protocol, Connectors or Services, we may freely use that feedback without any obligation to you.

3\. Security; Privacy
---------------------

(a) **API Security Measures.** You are responsible for the privacy, security, and integrity of your API and any Connector Requests that you receive. You will maintain at least reasonable and appropriate organizational, administrative, physical, and technical security measures to keep your API and Connector Requests secure. If you discover any vulnerabilities or breaches related to your API or a Connector Request, you must promptly contact us and provide details of the vulnerability or breach.

(b) **OpenAI Security Measures.** We will maintain reasonable and appropriate organizational, administrative, physical, and technical security measures designed to keep the Services secure, including protecting any developer credentials such as access tokens or client secrets that you give us. You may set and enforce limitations on our use of your API, such as rate limiting. We will not intentionally attempt to circumvent those limitations.

(c) **Privacy.** To the extent your Connector processes personal data or users are required to authenticate to your website or application, you will only process personal data (i) in accordance with applicable privacy laws, (ii) as authorized by the user and (iii) in accordance with a legally adequate privacy notice that is presented to the user prior to processing their data.

4\. Trademarks

You may not imply that we created, support, or endorse your Connector without our prior written consent. All goodwill derived from your use of OpenAI Trademarks will inure to our sole benefit.

You or we can terminate these Terms by removing your Connector from the Services for any reason by providing at least 30 days’ advance notice to the other party, except you can terminate the Terms immediately with notice to us if you determine that our use of your Connector exposes you, your users, or others to risk of liability or harm. We may suspend or terminate these Terms immediately if you materially breach these terms, we determine that your Connector exposes us or anyone else to risk of liability or harm, or to comply with law or government requests.

Material changes will be effective 15 days after we post them or otherwise notify you of them (except changes required by law which will be effective immediately). Any other changes to these Terms will be effective upon posting. Your continued availability of your Connector will constitute acceptance of the updated terms.
