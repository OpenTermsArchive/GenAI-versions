In addition, if you create an account using an email address belonging to your employer or another organization, we may share the fact that you have an account and certain account information, such as your email address, with your employer or organization to, for example, enable you to be added to their business account.

5\. Retention
-------------

We’ll retain your Personal Data for only as long as we need in order to provide our Services to you, or for other legitimate business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety and security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations. How long we retain Personal Data will depend on a number of factors, such as:

* Our purpose for processing the data (such as whether we need to retain the data to provide our Services);
* The amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information;
* The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure;
* Any legal requirements that we are subject to.

In some cases, the length of time we retain data depends on your settings. For example, ChatGPT temporary chats will not appear in your history and will be kept up to 30 days for safety purposes. You can find more information on data controls [here⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7730893-data-controls-faq).

6\. Your rights
---------------

You have the following statutory rights in relation to your Personal Data:

* Access your Personal Data and information relating to how it is processed.
* Delete your Personal Data from our records.
* Rectify or update your Personal Data.
* Transfer your Personal Data to a third party (right to data portability).
* Restrict how we process your Personal Data.
* Withdraw your consent—where we rely on consent as the legal basis for processing at any time.
* Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority (see below).

You have the following rights to object:

* Object to our processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing at any time.
* Object to how we process your Personal Data when our processing is based on legitimate interests.

You can exercise some of these rights through your OpenAI account. If you are unable to exercise your rights through your account, please submit your request through [privacy.openai.com⁠(opens in a new window)](http://privacy.openai.com/) or send it to [dsar@openai.com⁠](mailto:dsar@openai.com).

We hope that we are able to address any questions or concerns you may have. If you have any unresolved complaints with us or our Data Protection Officer, you can reach out to the [Irish Data Protection Commission⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) as our lead supervisory authority, or your [local supervisory authority⁠(opens in a new window)](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en). For any unresolved complaints relating to the UK you can reach out to the [Information Commissioner's Office⁠(opens in a new window)](https://ico.org.uk/) and for Switzerland, to the [Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).

A note about accuracy: Services like ChatGPT generate responses by reading a user’s request and, in response, predicting the words most likely to appear next. In some cases, the words most likely to appear next may not be the most factually accurate. For this reason, you should not rely on the factual accuracy of output from our models. If you notice that ChatGPT output contains factually inaccurate information about you and you would like to request a correction or removal of the information, you can submit these requests through privacy.openai.com or to [dsar@openai.com⁠](mailto:dsar@openai.com), and we will consider your request based on applicable law and the technical capabilities of our models.

For information on how to exercise your rights with respect to data we have collected from the internet to train our models, please see this [notice⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7842364-how-chatgpt-and-our-language-models-are-developed).

7\. Children
------------

Our Services are not directed to, or intended for, children under 13.  We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If you have reason to believe that a child under 13 has provided Personal Data to OpenAI through the Services, please email us at [privacy@openai.com⁠](mailto:privacy@openai.com). We will investigate any notification and, if appropriate, delete the Personal Data from our systems. Users under 18 must have permission from their parent or guardian to use our Services.

8\. Security
------------

We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you provide to the Services. In addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Service, or third-party websites.
