Using our Services
------------------

**What you can do**. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you may access and use our Services. In using our Services, you must comply with all applicable laws as well as the Service-specific terms and policies listed above.

**What you cannot do**. You may not use our Services for any illegal, harmful, or abusive activity. For example, you are prohibited from:

* Using our Services in a way that infringes, misappropriates or violates anyone’s rights.
* Misusing our reporting or appeals processes, including providing manifestly unfounded submissions.
* Modifying, copying, leasing, selling or distributing any of our Services.
* Attempting to or assisting anyone to reverse engineer, decompile or discover the source code or underlying components of our Services, including our models, algorithms, or systems (except to the extent this restriction is prohibited by applicable law).
* Automatically or programmatically extracting data or Output (defined below).
* Representing that Output was human-generated when it was not.
* Interfering with or disrupting our Services, including circumventing any rate limits or restrictions or bypassing any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.
* Using Output to develop models that compete with OpenAI.

**Software.** Our Services may allow you to download software, such as mobile applications, which may update automatically to ensure you’re using the latest version. Our software may include open source software that is governed by its own licences that we’ve made available to you.

**Corporate domains.** If you create an account using an email address owned by an organisation (for example, your employer), that account may be added to the organisation's business account with us, in which case we will provide notice to you so that you can help facilitate the transfer of your account (unless your organisation has already provided notice to you that it may monitor and control your account). Once your account is transferred, the organisation’s administrator will be able to control your account, including being able to access Content (defined below) and restrict or remove your access to the account.

**Third party Services**. Our services may include third party software, products, or services, (“Third Party Services”) and some parts of our Services, like our browse feature, may include output from those services (“Third Party Output”). Third Party Services and Third Party Output are subject to their own terms, and we are not responsible for them.

**Feedback**. We appreciate your feedback about our Services, but you agree that we may use it to provide, maintain, develop, and improve our Services, without compensation to you.

Content
-------

**Your content.** You may provide input to the Services (“**Input**”), and receive output from the Services based on the Input (“**Output**”). Input and Output are collectively “**Content**”. You are responsible for Content, including ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all rights, licences, and permissions needed to provide Input to our Services.

**Ownership of content.** As between you and OpenAI, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you (a) retain your ownership rights in Input and (b) own the Output. We hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output. 

**Similarity of content.** Due to the nature of our Services and artificial intelligence generally, Output may not be unique and other users may receive similar output from our Services. Our assignment above does not extend to other users’ output or any Third Party Output. 

**Our use of content.** We can use your Content worldwide to provide, maintain, develop, and improve our Services, comply with applicable law, enforce our terms and policies and keep our Services safe. If you're using ChatGPT through Apple's integrations, see [this Help Center article⁠⁠](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9737562) for how we handle your Content.

**Content moderation.** We use automated systems and human review to identify and address content that violates our Terms, including our Usage Policies. If we become aware of violations, we may remove or restrict content, limit your access to features, or suspend or terminate your account.

For more details on our content moderation process and complaint procedures, see our [Transparency & Content Moderation page](https://openai.com/transparency-and-content-moderation/).

**Opt out.** If you do not want us to use your Content to train our models, you have the option to opt out by updating your account settings. Further information can be found in [this article](https://openai.com/policies/how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance/). Please note that in some cases this may limit the ability of our Services to better address your specific use case.

**Accuracy**. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly working to improve our Services to make them more accurate, reliable, safe, and beneficial. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. 

When you use our Services you understand and agree:

* Output may not always be accurate. You should not rely on Output from our Services as a sole source of truth or factual information, or as a substitute for professional advice. 
* You must evaluate Output for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case, including using human review as appropriate, before using or sharing Output from the Services.
* You must not use any Output relating to a person for any purpose that could have a legal or material impact on that person, such as making credit, educational, employment, housing, insurance, legal, medical, or other important decisions about them. 
* Our Services may provide incomplete, incorrect, or offensive Output that does not represent OpenAI’s views. If Output references any third party products or services, it doesn’t mean the third party endorses or is affiliated with OpenAI.

Our IP rights
-------------

We and our affiliates own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services. You may only use our name and logo in accordance with our [Brand Guidelines⁠](https://openai.com/brand/).

Paid accounts

The exact nature of the Benefits differs between Services and will be made clear to you before purchase. You can manage your paid subscription from your account settings. 

**Fees:** All charges, including subscription fees, will be made clear to you before purchase. 

**Billing.** If you sign-up for a paid subscription or purchase any Services, you will provide complete and accurate billing information, including a valid payment method.

**Cooling off period.** You are entitled to cancel your purchase and request a refund without stating the reason during the 14 days following the date of your purchase (the “**Cooling Off Period**”).

To cancel and request a refund please [contact Support⁠](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6614161-how-can-i-contact-support) or fill out and send us the [model withdrawal form⁠](https://openai.com/form/model-withdrawal/), or alternatively you may complete the model withdrawal form as described under _**Termination and Suspension**_ below.

You will not be charged after you cancel your paid subscription. You will continue to have access to the Benefits until the end of the subscription period you have paid for, at which point your cancellation will become effective. Unless we specify otherwise, you will not receive a refund or service credit for any days between the day you cancel and the last day of the subscription period you have paid for.

**Changes.** We may change our prices from time to time. If we increase our subscription prices, we will give you at least 30 days’ notice and any price increase will take effect on your next renewal so that you can cancel if you do not agree to the price increase.

General terms
-------------

**Assignment.** You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms. We may assign or transfer our rights or obligations under these Terms to any affiliate or subsidiary or any successor in interest of any business associated with our Services. If we do, any rights you have as a consumer will not be affected. If you are not satisfied, you have the right to terminate your relationship with OpenAI and stop using our Services at any time.

**Changes to these Terms or our Services.** We are continuously working to develop and improve our Services. We may update these Terms or our Services accordingly from time to time. For example, we may make changes to these Terms or the Services due to:

* Changes we make in the usual course of developing our Services.
* To adapt to new technologies.

We will give you at least 30 days advance notice of changes that materially adversely impact you and the date that they will come into force either via email or an in-product notification.

**Delay in enforcing these Terms.** If we or you delay enforcing a provision of these Terms, either of us can still enforce it later, and it will not prevent us or you from taking steps against the other at a later date. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, it will not affect the enforceability of any other part of these Terms.

-----------------------------

Output generated by code generation features of our Services, including [OpenAI Codex⁠](https://openai.com/index/openai-codex/), may be subject to third party licenses, including, without limitation, open source licenses.

5\. GPTs
--------

Users can create and share access to their own customized versions of ChatGPT called “GPTs”.

For Builders of GPTs:

(a) **GPT Content**. The information or content that you upload to or include with your GPT (for example your GPT name, instructions, and description) (“GPT Content”) is your Content. As between you and OpenAI, you are solely responsible for your GPT Content, Actions, and configurations that you use or enable to create your GPT as well as any Output that is based on your GPT Content, Actions, and configurations. You must ensure your GPT complies with the Agreement and our [Usage Policies⁠](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/).

(b) **Distribution and Promotion of GPTs**. By sharing your GPT with others, you grant a nonexclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license: (i) to OpenAI to use, test, store, copy, translate, display, modify, distribute, promote, and otherwise make available to other users all or any part of your GPT (including GPT Content); and (ii) to the extent Output from your GPT includes your GPT Content, to users of your GPT to use, store, copy, display, distribute, prepare derivative works of and otherwise use your GPT Content. You will ensure that all information that you publish about your GPT is, at all times, complete, accurate, and not misleading.

(c) **Actions**. Any API, website, or service that interacts with a GPT (an “Action”) is subject to our [Connectors and Actions Terms](https://openai.com/policies/connectors-actions-terms/)⁠ and you are responsible for ensuring that any Action included with your GPT operates in compliance with those terms.

(d) **Removal**. We may reject or remove any GPT from our Services at any time for any reason without notice to you, such as for legal or security reasons or if your GPT violates our Terms.  

For Users of GPTs:

(a) **Third Party GPTs**. Except where OpenAI is identified as the builder of a GPT, GPTs are created by other users and they may rely on content or third party applications that are not controlled by OpenAI. Use of “GPT” in the name of a GPT created by other users does not imply that OpenAI created, supports or endorses the GPT. Only use GPTs that you know and trust.

(b) **Abuse Reporting**. You can report GPTs that violate our [Usage Policies⁠](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/) using our reporting feature within ChatGPT.

(c) **Actions**. GPTs may allow you to interact with Actions. Those Actions are subject to our terms for Connectors and Actions below.

(d) **Changes and Removal**. OpenAI and creators of GPTs can remove GPTs at any time for any reason without prior notice.

6\. Image and Video Capabilities
--------------------------------

Our models can accept images and videos as part of Inputs to the Services (“Visual Capabilities”). You may not use Visual Capabilities to assist in identifying a person nor to solicit or infer private or sensitive information about a person. You may not use Visual Capabilities to reproduce the likeness of any person without express consent and all necessary rights, nor to reproduce the likeness of anyone under 18. By choosing to share an image or video publicly on the Services, such as by sharing it to the Sora explore page, you give OpenAI the right to reproduce, distribute, modify, display and perform it for the purpose of operating and promoting the Services.

7\. Connectors and Actions
--------------------------

(a) **Overview**. Connectors and Actions (together “Connectors”) allow ChatGPT to send and receive information from a third-party application or website (“Application”). You may take action on an Application through one or more Connectors (for example, to request a reservation on a restaurant’s website). You are solely responsible for the actions you take using Connectors or adding custom Connectors, and you can control whether a Connector is enabled in your workspace. OpenAI may (but will have no obligation to) review, refuse, or remove Applications from ChatGPT. Third-party Connectors are not developed or verified by OpenAI, and may expose you to Applications or content that you may find offensive, inappropriate or objectionable. You agree that you use Connectors at your own risk. DO NOT ADD OR ENABLE A CONNECTOR UNLESS YOU KNOW AND TRUST THE UNDERLYING APPLICATION AND HAVE REVIEWED ITS TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY.

(b) **Connector Operation and Content.** When you add or enable a Connector, the Services may send applicable portions of your Content and certain information such as your country and state (“Connector Data”) via the Connector to the Application. By using or enabling the Connector, you authorize and instruct us to send your Connector Data to the applicable Application, which will be handled in accordance with its terms. We are not responsible for Connector Data after it has been provided to an Application other than Applications owned by us. The Connector may retrieve information and content from the Application, which may be included in Output you receive from the Services. This information and content included in the Output is not owned by you or OpenAI, and may be subject to the terms of the Application.

8\. Voice Conversations
-----------------------

Voice conversations is a ChatGPT feature that allows you to speak to our models and have them speak back (“ChatGPT Voice Output”). ChatGPT Voice Output is for non-commercial use only and may not be distributed or repackaged as a standalone audio recording or any other sound file. Any rights in Output assigned to you do not include ChatGPT Voice Output.

9\. Medical Use
---------------

Our Services are not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition. You are responsible for complying with applicable laws for any use of our Services in a medical or healthcare context.
