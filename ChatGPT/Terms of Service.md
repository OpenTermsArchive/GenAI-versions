You may not share your account credentials or make your account available to anyone else and are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. If you create an account or use the Services on behalf of another person or entity, you must have the authority to accept these Terms on their behalf.

Using our Services
------------------

**What you can do**. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you may access and use our Services. In using our Services, you must comply with all applicable laws as well as the Service-specific terms and policies listed above.

**What you cannot do**. You may not use our Services for any illegal, harmful, or abusive activity. For example, you are prohibited from:

* Using our Services in a way that infringes, misappropriates or violates anyone’s rights.
* Misusing our reporting or appeals processes, including providing manifestly unfounded submissions.
* Modifying, copying, leasing, selling or distributing any of our Services.
* Attempting to or assisting anyone to reverse engineer, decompile or discover the source code or underlying components of our Services, including our models, algorithms, or systems (except to the extent this restriction is prohibited by applicable law).
* Automatically or programmatically extracting data or Output (defined below).
* Representing that Output was human-generated when it was not.
* Interfering with or disrupting our Services, including circumventing any rate limits or restrictions or bypassing any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.
* Using Output to develop models that compete with OpenAI.

**Software.** Our Services may allow you to download software, such as mobile applications, which may update automatically to ensure you’re using the latest version. Our software may include open source software that is governed by its own licences that we’ve made available to you.

**Corporate domains.** If you create an account using an email address owned by an organisation (for example, your employer), that account may be added to the organisation's business account with us, in which case we will provide notice to you so that you can help facilitate the transfer of your account (unless your organisation has already provided notice to you that it may monitor and control your account). Once your account is transferred, the organisation’s administrator will be able to control your account, including being able to access Content (defined below) and restrict or remove your access to the account.

**Third party Services**. Our services may include third party software, products, or services, (“Third Party Services”) and some parts of our Services, like our browse feature, may include output from those services (“Third Party Output”). Third Party Services and Third Party Output are subject to their own terms, and we are not responsible for them.

**Feedback**. We appreciate your feedback about our Services, but you agree that we may use it to provide, maintain, develop, and improve our Services, without compensation to you.

Content
-------

**Your content.** You may provide input to the Services (“**Input**”), and receive output from the Services based on the Input (“**Output**”). Input and Output are collectively “**Content**”. You are responsible for Content, including ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all rights, licences, and permissions needed to provide Input to our Services.

**Ownership of content.** As between you and OpenAI, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you (a) retain your ownership rights in Input and (b) own the Output. We hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output. 

**Similarity of content.** Due to the nature of our Services and artificial intelligence generally, Output may not be unique and other users may receive similar output from our Services. Our assignment above does not extend to other users’ output or any Third Party Output. 

**Our use of content.** We can use your Content worldwide to provide, maintain, develop, and improve our Services, comply with applicable law, enforce our terms and policies and keep our Services safe. If you're using ChatGPT through Apple's integrations, see [this Help Center article⁠⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9737562) for how we handle your Content.

**Content moderation.** We use automated systems and human review to identify and address content that violates our Terms, including our Usage Policies. If we become aware of violations, we may remove or restrict content, limit your access to features, or suspend or terminate your account.

For more details on our content moderation process and complaint procedures, see our [Transparency & Content Moderation page](https://openai.com/transparency-and-content-moderation/).

**Opt out.** If you do not want us to use your Content to train our models, you have the option to opt out by updating your account settings. Further information can be found in [this article](https://openai.com/policies/how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance/). Please note that in some cases this may limit the ability of our Services to better address your specific use case.

**Accuracy**. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly working to improve our Services to make them more accurate, reliable, safe, and beneficial. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use of our Services may in some situations result in Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. 

When you use our Services you understand and agree:

* Output may not always be accurate. You should not rely on Output from our Services as a sole source of truth or factual information, or as a substitute for professional advice. 
* You must evaluate Output for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case, including using human review as appropriate, before using or sharing Output from the Services.
* You must not use any Output relating to a person for any purpose that could have a legal or material impact on that person, such as making credit, educational, employment, housing, insurance, legal, medical, or other important decisions about them. 
* Our Services may provide incomplete, incorrect, or offensive Output that does not represent OpenAI’s views. If Output references any third party products or services, it doesn’t mean the third party endorses or is affiliated with OpenAI.

Our IP rights
-------------

We and our affiliates own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services. You may only use our name and logo in accordance with our [Brand Guidelines⁠](https://openai.com/brand/).

Paid accounts
-------------

**Paid subscriptions.** Some of our Services allow you to purchase paid subscriptions to benefit from enhanced features and functionalities (the “**Benefits**”). The exact nature of the Benefits differs between Services and will be made clear to you before purchase. You can manage your paid subscription from your account settings. 

**Fees:** All charges, including subscription fees, will be made clear to you before purchase. 

**Billing.** If you sign-up for a paid subscription or purchase any Services, you will provide complete and accurate billing information, including a valid payment method. For paid subscriptions, we will automatically charge your payment method on each agreed-upon periodic renewal until you cancel. If your payment cannot be completed, we may downgrade your account or suspend your access to our Services until payment is received. 

**Service credits.** You can pay for some Services in advance by purchasing service credits. All service credits are subject to our [Service credit terms⁠](https://openai.com/policies/service-credit-terms/).

**Cooling off period.** You are entitled to cancel your purchase and request a refund without stating the reason during the 14 days following the date of your purchase (the “**Cooling Off Period**”). The refund will cover the relevant subscription fee prorated from the date you request cancellation to the end of the relevant subscription period you have paid for. To cancel and request a refund please [contact Support⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6614161-how-can-i-contact-support) or fill out and send us the [model withdrawal form⁠](https://openai.com/form/model-withdrawal/), or alternatively you may complete the model withdrawal form as described under _**Termination and Suspension**_ below.

**Cancellation.** Following the Cooling Off Period, you can [cancel⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7232927-how-do-i-cancel-my-chatgpt-plus-subscription) your paid subscription at any time by updating your account settings. You will not be charged after you cancel your paid subscription. You will continue to have access to the Benefits until the end of the subscription period you have paid for, at which point your cancellation will become effective. Unless we specify otherwise, you will not receive a refund or service credit for any days between the day you cancel and the last day of the subscription period you have paid for.

**Changes.** We may change our prices from time to time. If we increase our subscription prices, we will give you at least 30 days’ notice and any price increase will take effect on your next renewal so that you can cancel if you do not agree to the price increase.

**Assignment.** You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms. We may assign or transfer our rights or obligations under these Terms to any affiliate or subsidiary or any successor in interest of any business associated with our Services. If we do, any rights you have as a consumer will not be affected. If you are not satisfied, you have the right to terminate your relationship with OpenAI and stop using our Services at any time.

**Changes to these Terms or our Services.** We are continuously working to develop and improve our Services. We may update these Terms or our Services accordingly from time to time. For example, we may make changes to these Terms or the Services due to:

* Security or safety reasons.
* Circumstances beyond our reasonable control.
* Changes we make in the usual course of developing our Services.
* To adapt to new technologies.

We will give you at least 30 days advance notice of changes that materially adversely impact you and the date that they will come into force either via email or an in-product notification. Any changes will only apply to our relationship going forward. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using our Services.

**Delay in enforcing these Terms.** If we or you delay enforcing a provision of these Terms, either of us can still enforce it later, and it will not prevent us or you from taking steps against the other at a later date.

Business use of the Services addendum
-------------------------------------

**Commercial and business use**. If you use our Services for commercial or business use, the following terms apply. In the event of a conflict between this _**Business Use of the Services Addendum**_ and the rest of these Terms, this Addendum shall take precedence.

**Limitation of liability**. NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA OR OTHER LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED ​​THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE LIABILITY AROSE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
