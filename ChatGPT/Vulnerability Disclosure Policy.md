Coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy
===========================================

Security is essential to OpenAI’s mission. We value the input of hackers acting in good faith to help us maintain a high standard for the security and privacy for our users and technology. This includes encouraging responsible vulnerability research and disclosure.

Bug bounty
----------

The OpenAI Bug Bounty Program is a way for us to recognize and reward the valuable insights of security researchers who contribute to keeping our technology and company secure. We invite you to report vulnerabilities, bugs, or security flaws you discover in our systems. By sharing your findings, you will play a crucial role in making our technology safer for everyone.

Detailed guidelines and rules for participation can be found on our [Bug Bounty Program page⁠](https://bugcrowd.com/openai).

Incident reporting
------------------

To report a security incident, please [let us know immediately⁠](https://openai.com/security.txt) by submitting an encrypted report. Information shared with us in this manner must be shared unconditionally.

Outbound coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy
----------------------------------------------------

Rooted in integrity, cooperation, and a commitment to scale, this policy outlines how we work with others to strengthen the broader security ecosystem.
