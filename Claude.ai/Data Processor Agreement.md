Until the entry into force of the revised Swiss Data Protection Laws, the Clauses will also protect the personal data of legal entities and legal entities will receive the same protection under the Clauses as natural persons.

To the extent that any processing of personal data is subject to both Swiss Data Protection Laws and the GDPR, the DPA (including the Clauses as further specified in this Schedule) will apply (i) as is and (ii) additionally, to the extent that a transfer is subject to Swiss Data Protection Laws, as amended by Sections 1 and 3 of this Swiss Addendum, with the sole exception that Clause 17 of the SCCs will not be replaced as stipulated under Section 3(b)(vii) of this Swiss Addendum.
