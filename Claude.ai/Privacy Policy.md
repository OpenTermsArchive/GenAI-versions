Privacy Policy
==============

Effective October 8, 2025[Previous Version](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/archive/fbe2e87e-8f4e-4bba-9e5e-a6a8b15afc0e)

English

Anthropic is an AI safety and research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and process your personal data when you use our website and other places where Anthropic acts as a _data controller_—for example, when you interact with Claude.ai or other products as a consumer for personal use ("**Services**") or when Anthropic operates and provides our commercial customers and their end users with access to our commercial products, such as the Claude Team plan (“**Commercial Services**”).

This Privacy Policy does not apply where Anthropic acts as a _data processor_ and processes personal data on behalf of commercial customers using Anthropic’s Commercial Services – for example, your employer has provisioned you a Claude for Work account, or you're using an app that is powered on the back-end with Claude. In those cases, the commercial customer is the controller, and you can review their policies for more information about how they handle your personal data.

Please see our [Non-User Privacy Policy](https://anthropic.com/legal/non-user-privacy-policy) for information on how our large language models are ‘trained’ and how personal data obtained from third party sources, including where others may submit personal data when using our services, may be used when developing or delivering our products and services.

This Privacy Policy also describes your privacy rights. More information about your rights, and how to exercise them, is set out in Section 4 (“Rights and Choices”).

If you are located in Canada, please read section 11 of the Privacy Policy which applies to you.

If you are located in Brazil, please read section 12 of the Privacy Policy which applies to you.

1\. Collection of Personal Data
-------------------------------

We collect the following categories of personal data:

### Personal data you provide to us directly

* **Identity and Contact Data:** Anthropic collects identifiers, including your name, email address, and phone number when you sign up for an Anthropic account, or to receive information on our Services. We may also collect or generate indirect identifiers (e.g., “USER12345”).
* **Payment Information:** We shall collect your payment information if you choose to purchase access to Anthropic’s products and services.
* **Inputs and Outputs:** You are able to interact with our Services in a variety of formats, including but not limited to chat, coding, and agentic sessions (**“Prompts”** or **"Inputs"**), which generate responses and actions (**“Outputs”**) based on your Inputs.

5\. Data Transfers
------------------

When you access our website or Services, your personal data may be transferred to our servers in the US, or to other countries outside the European Economic Area (**“EEA”**) and the UK. This may be a direct provision of your personal data to us, or a transfer that we or a third party make.

Where information is transferred outside the EEA or the UK, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:

* **Adequacy decisions.** These are decisions from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country outside of the EEA offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “Collection of Personal Data” to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en); or
* **Standard contractual clauses.** The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “Collection of Personal Data” to certain affiliates and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.

In certain situations, we rely on derogations provided for under applicable data protection law to transfer information to a third country.

6\. Data Retention, Data Lifecycle, and Security Controls

Anthropic retains your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes and criteria outlined in this Privacy Policy and explained further in our [privacy center](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023548-how-long-do-you-store-personal-data).

When the personal data collected is no longer required by us, we and our service providers will perform the necessary procedures for destroying, deleting, erasing, or converting it into an anonymous form as permitted or required under applicable laws.

### Aggregated or De-Identified Information

We may process personal data in an aggregated or de-identified form to analyze the effectiveness of our Services, conduct research, study user behavior, and train our AI models as permitted under applicable laws. For instance:

* When you submit Feedback, we disassociate Inputs and Outputs from your user ID to use them for training and improving our models.
* If our systems flag Inputs or Outputs for potentially violating our [Usage Policy](https://anthropic.com/legal/aup), we disassociate the content from your user ID to train our trust and safety internal classification and generative models. However, we may re-identify the Inputs or Outputs to enforce our Usage Policy with the responsible user if necessary.
* To improve user experience, we may analyze and aggregate general user behavior and usage data. This information does not identify individual users.

Non-User Privacy Policy
=======================

Anthropic is an AI safety and research company, building reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.

We’ve prepared this notice (“**Notice**”) to explain how our large language models are ‘trained’ and how personal data obtained from third party sources may be used as part of the training process. We’ve also included information about the ways in which personal data of individuals who are not registered users of our services may incidentally be processed as part of our services, and the privacy rights such individuals may enjoy with respect to their personal data.

To understand how we collect and use information from registered users of our services, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy).

1\. What Claude Is
------------------

Claude is a content-based generative AI system used by many people around the world to assist with a wide range of tasks. These include improving writing, providing coding assistance, offering strategic advice, conducting business analysis, summarizing documents, and helping with various daily activities. It's available via both an API for developers and a public website (claude.ai) for individual users.

2\. How Our Models are Trained
------------------------------

Large language models such as Claude are ‘trained’ on a variety of content such as text, images and multimedia so that they can learn the patterns and connections between words and/or content. This training is essential so that the model performs effectively and safely.

Claude is trained in two steps: (1) pre-training and (2) post-training.

“Pre-training” involves the analysis of content in order for the model to understand the fundamentals of language – that is, syntax, the patterns and connections between words – as well as basic facts about the world. To understand the full diversity of language, the model is trained on large amounts of content (including text) that is converted into “tokens” (short chunks of text often just a few characters long, like common words, parts of longer words, or even punctuation marks). The model processes this content and builds a complex network of relationships between tokens. At the end of pretraining, the model can predict the most likely next word in a sequence based on the words that come before it, much like a sophisticated autocomplete feature.

**Models do not store text like a database, nor do they simply “mash-up” or “collage” existing content.** Models identify general patterns in text in order to help people create new content, and they do not have access to or pull from the original training data once the models have been trained.

“Post-training” helps make the model more useful, effective, and safe, by integrating human feedback. The model generates multiple responses to a given prompt, which are then evaluated by human reviewers based on criteria such as quality, helpfulness, safety, and accuracy. This reinforcement learning feedback loop helps align the model's outputs with human expectations and values, gradually improving a model’s ability to provide relevant and appropriate responses. In addition, further “fine-tuning” that provides the model with the examples of appropriate outputs (e.g., specific to a particular domain or use case) helps improve the model.

3\. Collection of Personal Data
-------------------------------

Anthropic may obtain personal data from the following third party sources in order to train our models:

* Publicly available information via the Internet
* Datasets that we obtain through agreements with third party businesses
* User inputs and outputs submitted as feedback, flagged for violating our [Usage Policy](https://anthropic.com/legal/aup), or where the user has opted into the use of inputs and outputs for model training

We do not actively set out to collect personal data to train our models. However, a large amount of data on the Internet relates to people, so our training data may incidentally include personal data.

We only use personal data included in our training data to help our models learn about language and how to understand and respond to it. We do not use such personal data to contact people, build profiles about them, to try to sell or market anything to them, or to sell the information itself to any third party.

Anthropic may also obtain personal data from our third-party partners, such as in content returned by web search providers, when we are developing or delivering product features like web search.

4\. Privacy Safeguards During Data Collection and Training
----------------------------------------------------------

We take steps to minimise the privacy impact on individuals as part of our data collection practices. Our general purpose crawling user agent ClaudeBot operates under strict policies and guidelines. For example, ClaudeBot does not access password protected pages or bypass CAPTCHA controls, and it respects ‘Do Not Crawl’ signals (robots.txt). For more information on how we collect publicly available data, see [https://anthropic.com/crawl](https://anthropic.com/crawl).

Additionally, **our models are specifically trained to respect privacy.** We have built key ‘privacy by design’ safeguards into the development of Claude through our adoption of “Constitutional AI”. This gives Claude a set of principles (i.e., a “constitution”) to guide the training of the Claude LLMs and to make judgments about outputs. These principles are based in part on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and include specific rules around protecting privacy, particularly of non-public figures. This trains the Claude LLMs to not disclose or repeat personal data which may have been incidentally captured in training data, even if prompted. For example, Claude is given the following principles as part of its “constitution”: “_Please choose the response that is most respectful of everyone’s privacy_” and “_Please choose the response that has the least personal, private, or confidential information belonging to others_”. For more information on how “Constitutional AI” works, see [https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution).

5\. Your Rights and Choices
---------------------------

Depending on where you live and the laws that apply in your country of residence, you may enjoy certain rights regarding your personal data, as described further below. We make all reasonable efforts to respond to such rights. However, please be aware that these rights are limited, and that the process by which we may need to action your requests regarding our training dataset are complex. We may also decline a request if we have a lawful reason for doing so. That said, we strive to prioritize the protection of personal data, and comply with all applicable privacy laws.

To exercise your rights, you or an authorised agent may submit a request by emailing us at [privacy@anthropic.com](mailto:privacy@anthropic.com). After we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. Anthropic will not discriminate based on the exercising of privacy rights you may have. Set out below is a summary of the rights which you may enjoy, depending on the laws that apply in your country of residence.

* **Right to know**: the right to know what personal data Anthropic processes about you, including the categories of personal data, the categories of sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purposes for collection, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it.
* **Access & data portability**: the right to request a copy of the personal data Anthropic processes about you, subject to certain exceptions and conditions. In certain cases, and subject to applicable law, you have the right to port your information.
* **Deletion**: the right to request that we delete personal data collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.
* **Correction**: the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal data Anthropic retains about you, subject to certain exceptions. Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Outputs. If Outputs contain factually inaccurate personal data relating to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make a reasonable effort to correct this information—but due to the technical complexity of large language models, it may not always be possible for us to do so.
* **Objection**: the right to object to processing of your personal data, including profiling conducted on grounds of public or legitimate interest. In places where such a right applies, we will no longer process the personal data in case of such objection unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
* **Restriction**: the right to restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.
* **Automated decision-making**: Anthropic does not engage in decision making based solely on automated processing or profiling in a manner which produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services).
* **Sale & targeted Anthropic marketing of its products and services**. Anthropic does not “sell” your personal data as that term is defined by applicable laws and regulations.

Set out below are additional details in relation to our legal bases for processing your personal data, how we disclose your personal data, how we may transfer your personal data to different regions, how we retain your personal data, and various contact details in case you wish to contact us or a supervisory body.

Use of Personal Data

7\. How We Disclose Personal Data
---------------------------------

Anthropic will disclose personal data to the following categories of third parties for the purposes explained in this Notice:

* **Affiliates**. Anthropic discloses personal data between and among its affiliates and related entities, meaning an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Anthropic. Our affiliates will only use any personal data that we share in a manner consistent with this Notice.
* **Service providers & business partners**. Anthropic may disclose personal data with service providers and business partners for a variety of business purposes, including ensuring compliance with industry standards, research, auditing, and data processing. These parties will only access, process or store personal data that we share with them in accordance with our instructions.

Anthropic may also disclose personal data in the following circumstances:

* **As part of a significant corporate event**. If Anthropic is involved in a merger, corporate transaction, bankruptcy, or other situation involving the transfer of business assets, Anthropic will disclose your personal data as part of these corporate transactions.

**Pursuant to regulatory or legal requirements, safety, rights of others, and to enforce our rights or our terms**. We may disclose personal data to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for legal, tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal data to third parties in connection with claims, disputes or litigation, when otherwise permitted or required by law, or if we determine its disclosure is necessary to protect the health and safety of you or any other person, to protect against fraud or credit risk, to defend or enforce our legal rights or the legal rights of others, to enforce contractual commitments that you have made, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.

8\. Data Transfers
------------------

Your personal data may be transferred to our servers in the US, or to other countries outside the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”) and the UK.

Where information is transferred outside the EEA or the UK, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:

* **Adequacy decisions**. These are decisions from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country outside of the EEA offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “Collection of personal data” to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en); or
* **Standard contractual clauses**. The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “Collection of personal data” to certain affiliates and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.

In certain situations, we rely on derogations provided for under applicable data protection law to transfer information to a third country.

9\. Data Retention and Data Lifecycle
-------------------------------------

Anthropic retains your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes and criteria outlined in this Notice.

When the personal data collected is no longer required by us, we and our service providers will perform the necessary procedures for destroying, deleting, erasing, or converting it into an anonymous form as permitted or required under applicable laws.
