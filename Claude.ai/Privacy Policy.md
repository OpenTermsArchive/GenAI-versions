Privacy Policy
==============

Effective October 8, 2025[Previous Version](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/archive/fbe2e87e-8f4e-4bba-9e5e-a6a8b15afc0e)

English

Anthropic is an AI safety and research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and process your personal data when you use our website and other places where Anthropic acts as a _data controller_—for example, when you interact with Claude.ai or other products as a consumer for personal use ("**Services**") or when Anthropic operates and provides our commercial customers and their end users with access to our commercial products, such as the Claude Team plan (“**Commercial Services**”).

This Privacy Policy does not apply where Anthropic acts as a _data processor_ and processes personal data on behalf of commercial customers using Anthropic’s Commercial Services – for example, your employer has provisioned you a Claude for Work account, or you're using an app that is powered on the back-end with Claude. In those cases, the commercial customer is the controller, and you can review their policies for more information about how they handle your personal data.

Please see our [Non-User Privacy Policy](https://anthropic.com/legal/non-user-privacy-policy) for information on how our large language models are ‘trained’ and how personal data obtained from third party sources, including where others may submit personal data when using our services, may be used when developing or delivering our products and services.

This Privacy Policy also describes your privacy rights. More information about your rights, and how to exercise them, is set out in Section 4 (“Rights and Choices”).

If you are located in Canada, please read section 11 of the Privacy Policy which applies to you.

If you are located in Brazil, please read section 12 of the Privacy Policy which applies to you.

If you are located in the Republic of Korea, please read section 13 of the Privacy Policy which applies to you.

1\. Collection of Personal Data
-------------------------------

We collect the following categories of personal data:

### Personal data you provide to us directly

* **Identity and Contact Data:** Anthropic collects identifiers, including your name, email address, and phone number when you sign up for an Anthropic account, or to receive information on our Services. We may also collect or generate indirect identifiers (e.g., “USER12345”).
* **Payment Information:** We shall collect your payment information if you choose to purchase access to Anthropic’s products and services.
* **Inputs and Outputs:** You are able to interact with our Services in a variety of formats, including but not limited to chat, coding, and agentic sessions (**“Prompts”** or **"Inputs"**), which generate responses and actions (**“Outputs”**) based on your Inputs. This includes third-party applications you choose to integrate with our Services. If you include personal data or reference external content in your Inputs, we will collect that information and this information may be reproduced in your Outputs.
* **Feedback on your use of our Services:** We appreciate feedback, including ideas and suggestions for improvement or rating an Output in response to an Input ("**Feedback**"). If you rate an Output in response to an Input—for example, by using the thumbs up/thumbs down icon—we will store the entire related conversation as part of your Feedback. You can learn more about how we use Feedback [here](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023565-how-does-anthropic-use-submitted-feedback).
* **Communication Information:** If you communicate with us, including via our chatbot on our Help site, we collect your name, contact information, and the contents of any messages you send.

### Personal data we receive automatically from your use of the Services

When you use the Services, we also receive certain technical data automatically (described below, collectively “**Technical Information**”). This includes:

* **Device and Connection Information.** Consistent with your device or browser permissions, your device or browser automatically sends us information about when and how you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as your device type, operating system information, browser information and web page referers, mobile network, connection information, mobile operator or internet service provider (ISP), time zone setting, IP address (including information about the location of the device derived from your IP address), identifiers (including device or advertising identifiers, probabilistic identifiers, and other unique personal or online identifiers), and device location.
* **Usage Information.** We collect information about your use of the Services, such as the dates and times of access, browsing history, search, information about the links you click, pages you view, and other information about how you use the Services, and technology on the devices you use to access the Services.
* **Log and Troubleshooting Information.** We collect information about how our Services are performing when you use them. This information includes log files. If you or your device experiences an error, we may collect information about the error, the time the error occurred, the feature being used, the state of the application when the error occurred, and any communications or content provided at the time the error occurred.
* **Cookies & Similar Technologies.** We and our service providers use cookies, scripts, or similar technologies (“**Cookies**”) to manage the Services and to collect information about you and your use of the Services. These technologies help us to recognize you, customize or personalize your experience, market additional products or services to you, and analyze the use of our Services to make them safer and more useful to you. For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out controls and other options, please visit our [Cookie Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/cookies).

### Personal data we collect or receive to train our models

Anthropic obtains personal data from third party sources in order to train our models. Specifically, we train our models using data from the following sources:

* Publicly available information via the Internet
* Datasets that we obtain through commercial agreements with third party businesses
* Data that our users or crowd workers provide, including Inputs and Outputs from our Services (unless users opt out)
* Feedback that users explicitly provide about our Services

* To communicate with you, including to send you information about our Services and events;
* To create and administer your Anthropic account;
* To facilitate payments for products and services provided by Anthropic;
* To prevent and investigate fraud, abuse, and violations of our [Usage Policy](https://anthropic.com/legal/aup), unlawful or criminal activity, unauthorized access to or use of personal data or Anthropic systems and networks, to protect our rights and the rights of others, and to meet legal, governmental and institutional policy obligations;

Even if you opt-out, we will use Inputs and Outputs for model improvement when: (1) your conversations are flagged for safety review to improve our ability to detect harmful content, enforce our policies, or advance AI safety research, or (2) you've explicitly reported the materials to us (for example via our feedback mechanisms).

Please see Section 10 below for details of our legal bases for processing your personal data.

3\. How We Disclose Personal Data
---------------------------------

Anthropic will disclose personal data to the following categories of third parties for the purposes explained in this Policy:

* **Affiliates & corporate partners.** Anthropic discloses the categories of personal data described above between and among its affiliates and related entities.
* **Service providers & business partners.** Anthropic may disclose the categories of personal data described above with service providers and business partners for a variety of business purposes, including website and data hosting, ensuring compliance with industry standards, research, auditing, data processing, and providing you with the services.

Anthropic may also disclose personal data in the following circumstances:

* **As part of a significant corporate event.** If Anthropic is involved in a merger, corporate transaction, bankruptcy, or other situation involving the transfer of business assets, Anthropic will disclose your personal data as part of these corporate transactions.
* **Third-Party Websites and Services:** Our Services may involve integrations with, or may direct you to, websites, apps, and services managed by third parties. By interacting with these third parties, you are providing information directly to the third party and not Anthropic and subject to the third party’s privacy policy.If you access third-party services, such as social media sites or other sites linked through the Services (e.g., if you follow a link to our Twitter account), these third-party services will be able to collect personal data about you, including information about your activity on the Services. If we link to a site or service via our Services, you should read their data usage policies or other documentation. Our linking to another site or service doesn’t mean we endorse it or speak for that third party.
* **Pursuant to regulatory or legal requirements, safety, rights of others, and to enforce our rights or our terms.** We may disclose personal data to governmental regulatory authorities as required by law, including for legal, tax or accounting purposes, in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations. We may also disclose personal data to third parties in connection with claims, disputes or litigation, when otherwise permitted or required by law, or if we determine its disclosure is necessary to protect the health and safety of you or any other person, to protect against fraud or credit risk, to enforce our legal rights or the legal rights of others, to enforce contractual commitments that you have made, or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law.
* **With an individual's consent.** Anthropic will otherwise disclose personal data when an individual gives us permission or directs us to disclose this information, including as a part of our Services.

You can find information on our [Subprocessor List](https://www.anthropic.com/subprocessors) about the third parties Anthropic engages to help us process personal data provided to us where Anthropic acts as a data processor, such as with respect to personal data we receive, process, store, or host when you use Anthropic's commercial services.

4\. Rights and Choices
----------------------

Depending on where you live and the laws that apply in your country of residence, you may enjoy certain rights regarding your personal data, as described further below. However, please be aware that these rights are limited, and that the process by which we may need to action your requests regarding our training dataset are complex. We may also decline a request if we have a lawful reason for doing so. That said, we strive to prioritize the protection of personal data, and comply with all applicable privacy laws.

To exercise your rights, you or an authorized agent may submit a request by emailing us at [privacy@anthropic.com](mailto:privacy@anthropic.com). After we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. You may also have the right to appeal requests that we deny by emailing [privacy@anthropic.com](mailto:privacy@anthropic.com). Anthropic will not discriminate based on the exercising of privacy rights you may have. Set out below is a summary of the rights which you may enjoy, depending on the laws that apply in your country of residence.

* **Right to know:** the right to know what personal data Anthropic processes about you, including the categories of personal data, the categories of sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purposes for collection, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it.
* **Access & data portability:** the right to request a copy of the personal data Anthropic processes about you, subject to certain exceptions and conditions. In certain cases and subject to applicable law, you have the right to port your information.
* **Deletion:**the right to request that we delete personal data collected from you when you use our Services, subject to certain exceptions. You also are able to [delete individual conversations](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8230524-how-can-i-delete-or-rename-a-conversation), which will be removed immediately from your conversation history and automatically deleted from our back-end within 30 days. Learn more [here](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023548-how-long-do-you-store-personal-data).
* **Correction:**the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal data Anthropic retains about you, subject to certain exceptions. Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Outputs. If Outputs contain factually inaccurate personal data relating to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make a reasonable effort to correct this information—but due to the technical complexity of our large language models, it may not always be possible for us to do so.
* **Objection:** the right to object to processing of your personal data, including profiling conducted on grounds of public or legitimate interest. In places where such a right applies, we will no longer process the personal data in case of such objection unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. If we use your information for direct marketing, you can object and opt out of future direct marketing messages using the unsubscribe link in such communications.
* **Restriction:** the right to restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.
* **Withdrawal of consent.** Where Anthropic’s processing of your personal data is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
* **Automated decision-making**: Anthropic does not engage in decision making based solely on automated processing or profiling in a manner which produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services).
* **Sale & targeted Anthropic marketing of its products and services**. Anthropic does not “sell” your personal data as that term is defined by applicable laws and regulations. You can opt-out of sharing your personal data for targeted advertising to promote our products and services, and we will honor global privacy controls.

Anthropic gives you access to a variety of tools to help you manage your data. You can access these in your [Privacy Settings](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.69d910d1-06b6-4d1a-bea0-f21b207aaf8a/settings/privacy).

5\. Data Transfers
------------------

When you access our website or Services, your personal data may be transferred to our servers in the US, or to other countries outside the European Economic Area (**“EEA”**) and the UK. This may be a direct provision of your personal data to us, or a transfer that we or a third party make.

Where information is transferred outside the EEA or the UK, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:

* **Adequacy decisions.** These are decisions from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country outside of the EEA offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “Collection of Personal Data” to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en); or
* **Standard contractual clauses.** The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “Collection of Personal Data” to certain affiliates and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.

In certain situations, we rely on derogations provided for under applicable data protection law to transfer information to a third country.

6\. Data Retention, Data Lifecycle, and Security Controls
---------------------------------------------------------

Anthropic retains your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes and criteria outlined in this Privacy Policy and explained further in our [privacy center](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023548-how-long-do-you-store-personal-data).

When the personal data collected is no longer required by us, we and our service providers will perform the necessary procedures for destroying, deleting, erasing, or converting it into an anonymous form as permitted or required under applicable laws.

### Aggregated or De-Identified Information

We may process personal data in an aggregated or de-identified form to analyze the effectiveness of our Services, conduct research, study user behavior, and train our AI models as permitted under applicable laws. For instance:

* When you submit Feedback, we disassociate Inputs and Outputs from your user ID to use them for training and improving our models.
* If our systems flag Inputs or Outputs for potentially violating our [Usage Policy](https://anthropic.com/legal/aup), we disassociate the content from your user ID to train our trust and safety internal classification and generative models. However, we may re-identify the Inputs or Outputs to enforce our Usage Policy with the responsible user if necessary.
* To improve user experience, we may analyze and aggregate general user behavior and usage data. This information does not identify individual users.

### Security Controls Relating to our Processing of Personal Data

We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

7\. Children
------------

Our Services are not directed towards, and we do not knowingly collect, use, disclose, sell, or share any information from children under the age of 18. If you become aware that a child under the age of 18 has provided any personal data to us while using our Services, please email us at [privacy@anthropic.com](mailto:privacy@anthropic.com) and we will investigate the matter and, if appropriate, delete the personal data.

Legal Bases. Depending on the specific purpose of the processing, we may rely on different grounds than those listed under section 2, where permitted by and in accordance with the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD). For example, we may rely on the "exercise of legal rights" basis to process personal data associated with customer complaints and to enforce our Terms of Service and similar terms and agreements, including our Usage Policy.

For example, in certain cases we may continue to process and retain data regardless of your request for deletion, objection, blocking or anonymisation, in order to comply with legal, contractual and regulatory obligations, safeguard and exercise rights, including in judicial, administrative and arbitration proceedings and in other cases provided for by law.

International Data Transfers. You acknowledge that Anthropic is a company based and headquartered in the United States.

For the proper operation of the Services, Anthropic needs to carry out international transfers of personal data. In the case of Brazil, we will rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for our data transfers where required and in instances where they are not covered by an adequacy decision. These SCCs have been approved by the Brazilian Data Protection Authority (ANPD), which is the "competent supervisory authority" for these transfers, as governed by Brazilian Data Protection Laws. You can view the SCCs adopted by the ANPD [here](https://www.in.gov.br/en/web/dou/-/resolucao-cd/anpd-n-19-de-23-de-agosto-de-2024-580095396).

2\. How Our Models are Trained
------------------------------

Large language models such as Claude are ‘trained’ on a variety of content such as text, images and multimedia so that they can learn the patterns and connections between words and/or content. This training is essential so that the model performs effectively and safely.

Claude is trained in two steps: (1) pre-training and (2) post-training.

“Pre-training” involves the analysis of content in order for the model to understand the fundamentals of language – that is, syntax, the patterns and connections between words – as well as basic facts about the world. To understand the full diversity of language, the model is trained on large amounts of content (including text) that is converted into “tokens” (short chunks of text often just a few characters long, like common words, parts of longer words, or even punctuation marks). The model processes this content and builds a complex network of relationships between tokens. At the end of pretraining, the model can predict the most likely next word in a sequence based on the words that come before it, much like a sophisticated autocomplete feature.

**Models do not store text like a database, nor do they simply “mash-up” or “collage” existing content.** Models identify general patterns in text in order to help people create new content, and they do not have access to or pull from the original training data once the models have been trained.

“Post-training” helps make the model more useful, effective, and safe, by integrating human feedback. The model generates multiple responses to a given prompt, which are then evaluated by human reviewers based on criteria such as quality, helpfulness, safety, and accuracy. This reinforcement learning feedback loop helps align the model's outputs with human expectations and values, gradually improving a model’s ability to provide relevant and appropriate responses. In addition, further “fine-tuning” that provides the model with the examples of appropriate outputs (e.g., specific to a particular domain or use case) helps improve the model.

3\. Collection of Personal Data
-------------------------------

Anthropic may obtain personal data from the following third party sources in order to train our models:

* Publicly available information via the Internet
* Datasets that we obtain through agreements with third party businesses
* User inputs and outputs submitted as feedback, flagged for violating our [Usage Policy](https://anthropic.com/legal/aup), or where the user has opted into the use of inputs and outputs for model training

We do not actively set out to collect personal data to train our models. However, a large amount of data on the Internet relates to people, so our training data may incidentally include personal data.

We only use personal data included in our training data to help our models learn about language and how to understand and respond to it. We do not use such personal data to contact people, build profiles about them, to try to sell or market anything to them, or to sell the information itself to any third party.

Anthropic may also obtain personal data from our third-party partners, such as in content returned by web search providers, when we are developing or delivering product features like web search.

4\. Privacy Safeguards During Data Collection and Training
----------------------------------------------------------

We take steps to minimise the privacy impact on individuals as part of our data collection practices. Our general purpose crawling user agent ClaudeBot operates under strict policies and guidelines. For example, ClaudeBot does not access password protected pages or bypass CAPTCHA controls, and it respects ‘Do Not Crawl’ signals (robots.txt). For more information on how we collect publicly available data, see [https://anthropic.com/crawl](https://anthropic.com/crawl).

Additionally, **our models are specifically trained to respect privacy.** We have built key ‘privacy by design’ safeguards into the development of Claude through our adoption of “Constitutional AI”. This gives Claude a set of principles (i.e., a “constitution”) to guide the training of the Claude LLMs and to make judgments about outputs. These principles are based in part on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and include specific rules around protecting privacy, particularly of non-public figures. This trains the Claude LLMs to not disclose or repeat personal data which may have been incidentally captured in training data, even if prompted. For example, Claude is given the following principles as part of its “constitution”: “_Please choose the response that is most respectful of everyone’s privacy_” and “_Please choose the response that has the least personal, private, or confidential information belonging to others_”. For more information on how “Constitutional AI” works, see [https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution).

5\. Your Rights and Choices
---------------------------

Depending on where you live and the laws that apply in your country of residence, you may enjoy certain rights regarding your personal data, as described further below. We make all reasonable efforts to respond to such rights. However, please be aware that these rights are limited, and that the process by which we may need to action your requests regarding our training dataset are complex. We may also decline a request if we have a lawful reason for doing so. That said, we strive to prioritize the protection of personal data, and comply with all applicable privacy laws.

To exercise your rights, you or an authorised agent may submit a request by emailing us at [privacy@anthropic.com](mailto:privacy@anthropic.com). After we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. Anthropic will not discriminate based on the exercising of privacy rights you may have. Set out below is a summary of the rights which you may enjoy, depending on the laws that apply in your country of residence.

* **Right to know**: the right to know what personal data Anthropic processes about you, including the categories of personal data, the categories of sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purposes for collection, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it.
