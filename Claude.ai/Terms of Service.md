=========================

Effective September 28, 2025[Previous Version](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/archive/ce2bf436-0a91-4da2-a756-b2289fc755cd)

Note: This policy is effective on September 28, 2025 or the date you acknowledge these updated Terms within our Services (if earlier).

**Welcome to Anthropic! Before you access our services, please read these Terms of Service.**

These Terms of Service ("**Terms**") and our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://anthropic.com/aup) set out the agreement between you and Anthropic Ireland, Limited (“**Anthropic**”) (and not our affiliates, licensors, distributors and service providers (collectively “**Providers**”)) to use Claude.ai, Claude Pro, and other products and services that we may offer for individuals (including any Anthropic API key and the Anthropic Console, when used by individuals), along with any associated apps, software, and websites (together, our “**Services**”). Please take some time to read over them and understand them. By using our Services you agree to be bound by them, including any changes made to them in accordance with the Terms.

These Terms apply to you if you are a consumer who is resident in the United Kingdom. You are a consumer if you are acting wholly or mainly outside your trade, business, craft or profession in using our Services.

In these Terms, when we refer to “we”, “us” or “our,” or similar, we mean Anthropic. Other words in **bold** and quotation marks have the meaning given to them where the word or phrase is first used. Subsequent uses of these words have the same meaning unless otherwise stated.

Please read our [Privacy Policy](https://anthropic.com/privacy), which describes how we collect and use personal information.

**Please note: If you are acting on behalf of an organization, company, or other entity, our [Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms) govern your use of any Anthropic API key, the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/), or any other Anthropic offerings that reference the Commercial Terms of Service. For clarity, this does not include Claude.ai or Claude Pro use for individuals or entities.**

1\. Who we are.
---------------

Anthropic is an AI safety and research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We conduct frontier research, develop and apply a variety of safety techniques, and deploy the resulting systems via a set of partnerships and products.

2\. Account creation and access.
--------------------------------

**Minimum age.** You must be at least 18 years old to use the Services.

**Your Anthropic Account.** To access our Services, we may ask you to create an account (your “**Account**”), to provide certain information (such as your email address), and to create a password. You agree to provide correct, current, and complete information and allow us to use it to communicate with you about our Services. You agree to notify us promptly if there are any changes to the information you have provided to us. Our communications to you using such information will satisfy any requirements for legal notices.

You may not share your Account login information, Anthropic API key, or Account credentials with anyone else or make your Account available to anyone else. You are responsible for all activity occurring under your Account and agree to notify us immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized access to your Account by sending an email to [support@anthropic.com](mailto:support@anthropic.com).

You may close your Account at any time by contacting us at [support@anthropic.com](mailto:support@anthropic.com).

**Business Domains.** If you use an email address owned by your employer or another organization, your Account may be linked to the organization’s enterprise account with us and the organization’s administrator may be able to monitor and control the Account, including having access to Materials (defined below). We will provide notice to you before linking your Account to an organization's enterprise account. However, if the organization is responsible for notifying you or has already informed you that it may monitor and control your Account, we may not provide additional notice.

**Evaluation and Additional Services.** In some cases, we may permit you to evaluate our Services for a limited time or with limited functionality. Use of our Services for evaluation purposes are for your personal, non-commercial use only.

You may need to accept additional terms to use certain Services. These additional terms will supplement our Terms for those Services and may change your rights or obligations for those Services, including your obligations to pay fees.

3\. Use of our Services.
------------------------

You may access and use our Services only in compliance with our Terms, including our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://anthropic.com/aup), the policy governing [the countries and regions Anthropic currently supports](https://www.anthropic.com/supported-countries) (“Supported Regions Policy”), and any guidelines or supplemental terms we may post on the Services (the “**Permitted Use**”). You are responsible for all activity under the account through which you access the Services.

You may not access or use, or help another person to access or use, our Services in the following ways:

1. In any manner that violates any applicable law or regulation—including, without limitation, any laws about exporting data or software to and from the United Kingdom or other countries.
2. To develop any products or services that compete with our Services, including to develop or train any artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms or models or resell the Services.
3. To decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce our Services to human-readable form, except when these restrictions are prohibited by applicable law.
4. To crawl, scrape, or otherwise harvest data or information from our Services other than as permitted under these Terms.
5. To use our Services, the Materials, or the Actions to obtain unauthorized access to any system or information or to deceive any person.
6. To infringe, misappropriate, or violate intellectual property or other legal rights (including the rights of publicity or privacy).
7. Except when you are accessing our Services via an Anthropic API Key or where we otherwise explicitly permit it, to access the Services through automated or non-human means, whether through a bot, script, or otherwise.
8. To engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits any person from using or enjoying our Services, or that we reasonably believe exposes us—or any of our users, affiliates, or any other third party—to any liability, damages, or detriment of any type, including reputational harms.
9. To rely upon the Services, the Materials, or the Actions to buy or sell securities or to provide or receive advice about securities, commodities, derivatives, or other financial products or services, as Anthropic is not a broker-dealer or a registered investment adviser under the securities laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

You also must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our Services, including, for example, introducing viruses or malware, spamming or DDoSing Services, or bypassing any of our systems or protective measures.

4\. Inputs, Outputs, Actions, and Materials.
--------------------------------------------

**Generally.** You may be allowed to interact with our Services in a variety of formats (we call these “**Inputs**”). Our Services may generate responses (we call these “**Outputs**”) or enable the Services to take actions on your behalf, such as software manipulation, data processing, and system interactions (we call these **"Actions"**), based on your Inputs. Inputs and Outputs collectively are “**Materials**.”

**Rights and Responsibilities.** You are responsible for all Inputs you submit to our Services and all Actions. You must ensure that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions that are necessary for us to process such Inputs in accordance with our Terms and to provide the Services to you, including for example, to integrate with third-party services, to share Materials with others at your direction, and to take Actions. You must ensure that your submission of Inputs to us, or your sharing them with others, will not violate our Terms, our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://anthropic.com/aup), or any laws or regulations applicable to those Inputs or Actions. As between you and Anthropic, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you retain any right, title, and interest that you have in such Inputs. Subject to your compliance with our Terms, we assign to you all our right, title, and interest (if any) in Outputs.

**Reliance on Outputs and Actions.** Artificial intelligence and large language models are frontier technologies that are still improving in accuracy, reliability and safety. When you use our Services, you acknowledge and agree:

1. Outputs may not always be accurate and may contain material inaccuracies even if they appear accurate because of their level of detail or specificity.
2. Actions may not be error free or operate as you intended.
3. You should not rely on any Outputs or Actions without independently confirming their accuracy.
4. The Services and any Outputs may not reflect correct, current, or complete information.
5. Outputs may contain content that is inconsistent with Anthropic’s views.

**Our use of Materials.** We may use Materials to provide, maintain, and improve the Services, including training our models, unless you opt out of training through your account settings. Even if you opt out, we will use Materials for model training when: (1) you provide Feedback to us regarding any Materials, or (2) your Materials are flagged for safety review to improve our ability to detect harmful content, enforce our policies, or advance our safety research.

**Limitations.** Different types of Service (including paid-for Services under a Subscription) may have technical restrictions associated with them, for example, the number of Prompts you may submit to the Service or the number of Outputs you may receive within a certain period of time (“**Technical Limitation**”). For more information about the Technical Limitations for each type of Service offering, see the relevant purchase page on our Website.

5\. Feedback
------------

We appreciate feedback, including ideas and suggestions for improvement or rating an Output in response to an Input (“**Feedback**”). If you rate an Output in response to an Input—for example, by using the thumbs up/thumbs down icon—we will store the related conversation as part of your Feedback. You have no obligation to give us Feedback, but if you do, you agree that we may use the Feedback however we choose without any obligation or other payment to you.

6\. Subscriptions, fees and payment.
------------------------------------

**Fees and billing.** You may be required to pay fees to access or use our Services or certain features of our Services. You are responsible for paying any applicable fees listed on the Services. The fees applicable to our Services (including information on how we calculate our fees) are set out on the [Model Pricing Page](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing) unless otherwise communicated to you by Anthropic in writing.

If you purchase access to our Services or features of our Services from us, you must provide complete and accurate billing information (“**Payment Method**”). You confirm that the card or bank account which is being used as your Payment Method is yours, or that you have the authorization of the account holder to use it. If you use a Payment Method which you are not authorized to use, you will be liable to us for any losses that we suffer as a result of your use of that Payment Method.

You agree that we may charge the Payment Method for any applicable fees listed on our Services and any applicable tax. If the fees for these Services or features are specified to be recurring or based on usage (for example, a Subscription (see below)), you agree that we may charge these fees and applicable taxes to the Payment Method on a periodic basis.

If you purchase access to our Services through a distributor (e.g. an app store) (“**App Distributor**”), then you will make payment to the App Distributor, and the App Distributor's terms in relation to payment methods, billing, and refunds will apply instead of these Terms.

Except as expressly provided in these Terms or where required by law, all payments are non-refundable. Please check your order carefully before confirming it, and see below for additional information about recurring charges for our subscriptions.

You agree that we will not be held liable for any errors caused by third-party payment processors used to process fees paid by you to us.

**Subscriptions.** To access Claude Pro and other subscription services we may make available to individuals, you must sign up for a subscription with us (a **“Subscription”**), first by creating an Account and then following the subscription procedure on our Services. When you sign up for a Subscription, you agree to these Terms.

a. **Subscription order.** Your order for a Subscription constitutes an offer by you to enter into a Subscription with us. We will confirm our acceptance of your order by sending you a confirmation email (the "**Confirmation Email**"). Sometimes we reject orders, for example, if you are located in a country where we do not offer the Service or the Service was mispriced by us. These Terms will become legally binding on you and us when we send you the Confirmation Email and each Subscription will incorporate these Terms.

b. **Subscription content, features, and services.** The content, features, and other services provided as part of your Subscription, and the duration of your Subscription, will be described in the order process. We may change or refresh the content, features, and other services from time to time, and we do not guarantee that any particular piece of content, feature, or other service will always be available through the Services.

c. **Subscription term and automatic renewal.** If your Subscription has a minimum term (the “**Initial Term**”), we will let you know during the order process. Your Subscription will last for the Initial Term and will automatically renew for an additional term equal in duration to the Initial Term and will continue to renew and incur charges for additional terms equal in duration to the Initial Term (each such additional term, a “**Renewal Term**”). For example, if you subscribe on January 25th for a Subscription with a one-month Initial Term, the Initial Term is January 25th to February 24th (inclusive) and then Renewal Terms will run from the 25th of one month to the 24th of the next month (inclusive).

d. **Subscription fees.** You will pay the fees, either to us or to the App Distributor, for the Initial Term and each subsequent Renewal Term up front at the start of that Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. We have the right to make changes to the fees applicable to your Subscription from time to time, although we will not make any change to the fees applicable to your Subscription during the current Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. If these changes result in an increase in the fees payable by you, we will inform you at least 30 days in advance of the change; you agree to the increase in fees payable by you unless you cancel the Subscription, as described in Sections (e-f) below, before the Renewal Term to which the increase in fees will apply.

e. **Subscription cancellation.** If you subscribed via our website, you may cancel your Subscription at any time by using a method we may provide to you through our products (for example, for Claude Pro, in your customer portal) or by notifying us at [support@anthropic.com](mailto:support@anthropic.com). If you subscribed via an app, you will need to cancel via the distributor according to the App Distributor terms. Learn more [here](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8325617-how-do-i-cancel-my-claude-pro-subscription). To avoid renewal and charges for the next Renewal Term, cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the last day of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term. In the example above, if you subscribe on January 25th for a Subscription that renews with a one-month Initial Term, you must cancel the Subscription per the instructions by February 23rd (24 hours before February 24th) to avoid renewal and charges for the next Renewal Term. In the event of a cancellation, your fees will not be refunded, but your access to the Services will continue through the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term for which you previously paid fees.

f. **Additional cancellation rights.** You have a legal right to change your mind and cancel the Subscription within 14 days of entering into the Subscription without giving a reason.

1. To exercise the right to cancel in the 14-day cancellation period, you must inform us of your decision to cancel the Subscription by making a clear statement to us of such decision before the cancellation period has expired. If you purchased your subscription on our website, the easiest way to do this is by cancelling your subscription in the customer portal, or you may contact us at [support@anthropic.com](mailto:support@anthropic.com). We will acknowledge your cancellation, e.g., through our online customer portal or console. For further details on how to cancel, please see [support.anthropic.com](https://support.anthropic.com/).
2. If you cancel the Subscription under Section 6(f)(1), we will reimburse you all payments received from you for the cancelled Subscription. We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel the Subscription. We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction; you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.
3. If you would like to use the Services during the 14-day cancellation period, you may do so by accessing the Services, but you acknowledge that your right to cancel the Subscription will be lost and you will not be entitled to any refund under Section 6(f)(2). If you have used the Services during the 14-day cancellation period, and wish to cancel the Subscription, you can still do so by following the process in Section (e) above, but you will not be entitled to a refund.
4. The 14-day cancellation period will not reset if you change subscription tiers or cancel and then resubscribe, as you have already had an opportunity to test the Services.
5. If you are not paying under a subscription billing model, you do not have a right to a refund of unused tokens.

g. **Subscriptions purchased through third parties.** Where you have purchased your Subscription through an App Distributor, your right to cancel under Section 6(f) above will be as set out in the App Distributor’s terms and Section 6(f) will not apply. The App Distributor's terms will set out how to notify the App Distributor that you want to cancel and how any fees will be refunded.

**Additional fees.** We may also increase the fees for access to our Services that do not require a Subscription. If we charge additional fees in connection with those Services, we will give you an opportunity to review and accept the additional fees before you are charged. Also, additional fees may apply for additional Services or features of the Services that we may make available. If you do not accept any such additional fees, we may discontinue your access to those Services or features.

7\. Third-party services and links
----------------------------------

Our Services may use or be used in connection with third-party content (**"Third-Party Content"**), services, or integrations. We do not control or accept responsibility for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of any Third-Party Content, services, and integrations, for which we make no representations or warranties. Your use of any Third-Party Content, services, and integrations is at your own risk and subject to any terms, conditions, or policies (including privacy policies) applicable to such third-party content, services, and integrations.

8\. Content Moderation
----------------------

Third-Party Content is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides it to our Services. Anthropic is under no obligation to host or serve Third-Party Content. Third-Party Content may appear in Inputs or Outputs and become part of Materials. If you see any Third-Party Content you believe does not comply with these Terms, including by violating the Acceptable Use Policy or the law, you can [report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeO9Hzkyf_hQ2fYkfP_cqAcJG5kdlkg1wF4drQEFK9Z6db7jg/viewform) it to us.

If we become aware that any Third-Party Content (1) infringes another’s copyright or any other intellectual property or related or neighboring right, (2) is in breach of these Terms or our Acceptable Use Policy, or (3) may cause harm to Anthropic, our users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down some or all of such Third-Party Content using, where appropriate, algorithmic and human review.

You can learn more about our monitoring and enforcement, including how to appeal an account suspension or termination, in our [T&S Support Center](https://support.anthropic.com/en/collections/4078535-trust-safety).

If you posted the Third-Party Content or own it, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for Anthropic; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Services; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, or Anthropic. You can appeal a takedown of Third-Party Content by responding to the notice you receive from us.

You have a right to bring a claim for breach of contract in respect of these Terms in the event that (i) content which you generate, upload or share on our Services is taken down, or access to it is restricted, in breach of these Terms or (ii) your access is suspended (including any ban imposed on your use of our Services) in breach of these Terms.

9\. **Software**
----------------

We may offer manual or automatic updates to our software including our apps (“**Anthropic Software**”), without advance notice to you. Anthropic Software may include open source software. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other Anthropic or third-party terms applicable to any portion of Anthropic Software, such as open-source license terms, such other terms will control as to that portion of the Anthropic Software and to the extent of the conflict.

10\. Ownership of the Services
------------------------------

The Services are owned, operated, and provided by us and our Providers. We and our Providers retain all our respective rights, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Services. Other than the rights of access and use expressly granted in our Terms, our Terms do not grant you any right, title, or interest in or to our Services.

11\. Disclaimer of warranties, limitations of liability, and indemnity
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our team works hard to provide great services, and we’re continuously working on improvements. However, there are certain aspects we can’t guarantee.

**No warranties**. You may have legal rights in relation to our Services, including where the Services are not as described, faulty or otherwise not fit for purpose. If you believe that any of our Services that you have ordered do not conform with these Terms, please contact us at [support@anthropic.com](mailto:support@anthropic.com). Other than those legal rights, your use of the Services, Materials, and Actions is solely at your own risk. The Services, Outputs, and Actions are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis and, to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, are provided without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. We and our Providers expressly disclaim any and all warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, title, merchantability, accuracy, availability, reliability, security, privacy, compatibility, non-infringement, and any warranty implied by course of dealing, course of performance, or trade usage.

**No limitation.** Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability for:

1. death or personal injury caused by our negligence;
2. fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; and
3. any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for us to exclude or restrict our liability. If you have a paid-for Subscription, this includes your rights that the Services are of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose and as described.

**Foreseeable loss.** Except as set out in _No Limitation_ above, if we fail to comply with these Terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms or our negligence, but we (and our Providers) are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated by you and us at the time that you accessed our Services, or if you have a Subscription, at the time that the agreement between you and us related to your Subscription become binding (i.e., when the confirmation email for that Subscription was issued).

**Non-commercial use only.** You agree not to use our Services for any commercial or business purposes and we (and our Providers) have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.

**Your rights.** Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights and we are under a legal duty to provide you with Services that are in conformity with the terms applying to your Subscription. Advice about your statutory rights is available from your local Citizens’ Advice Bureau or Trading Standards Office (or local equivalent).

**Limitation of liability.** Except as otherwise set out in this Section 10, our total liability to you for any loss or damage arising out of or in connection with these Terms, whether in contract (including under any indemnity), tort (including negligence) or otherwise will be limited to the greater of: (a) the amount you paid to us for access to or use of the Services in the six months prior to the event giving rise to the liability, and (b) £100.

**Beneficiaries**. Our Providers may benefit from, and enforce, their rights under this Section 10.

12\. General terms
------------------

**Changes to the Services.** Our Services are novel and will change. We may sometimes add or remove features, increase or decrease capacity limits, offer new Services, or stop offering old ones. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services or your access to the Services. Where those actions will materially impact your use of the Services, we will endeavor to notify you in accordance with this section. This includes taking such action as we consider appropriate to address any security, performance or trust and safety issue.

Where feasible, we will provide you with at least 30 days’ advance notice of any such changes to the Services that would materially limit or reduce the features, availability or functionality of the Services. However, there may be urgent situations (such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues) where providing advance notice is not feasible.

If you do not wish to continue using the Services following material changes to the Services, please cancel your Account (or the Subscription purchased via our website, if applicable) by notifying us at [support@anthropic.com](mailto:support@anthropic.com) and we will refund you a portion of the fees paid by you that are for the portion of your Subscription purchased via our website remaining after termination of your Subscription occurs. Any refunds for Subscriptions purchased via an App Distributor are subject to the App Distributor’s terms and not these terms.

**Changes to the Terms.** ﻿﻿We may revise and update these Terms. For example, we may update these Terms (1) to reflect changes in our Services, like when we add or remove features or services, or update our pricing, (2) for security or legal reasons, or (3) to promote safety or prevent abuse. We will notify you of changes to the Terms which are reasonably likely to affect your use of the Services or legal rights. These changes will come into effect no less than 30 days from when we notify you, unless the change is due to a change in law or for security reasons (in which case we may need to change the Terms on shorter notice).

If you do not wish to continue using our Services following any changes to the Terms you can terminate these Terms (or a Subscription purchased via our website) by notifying us at [support@anthropic.com](mailto:support@anthropic.com), before the changes take effect. If you exercise this termination right, we will refund to you a portion of the fees paid by you that are for the portion of your Subscription purchased via our website remaining after termination of your Subscription occurs. Any refunds for Subscriptions purchased via an App Distributor are subject to the App Distributor’s terms and not these Terms.

**Supplemental terms.** We may offer new Services or features that we believe require service-specific terms or guidelines. If you decide to use those new Services or features, you agree to comply with any applicable guidelines, rules, or supplemental terms that may be posted on the Services from time to time (**“Supplemental Terms”**). If these Terms conflict with Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will govern for the applicable Service.

**Entire agreement.** These Terms and any other terms expressly incorporated by reference form the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter of our Terms.

**Termination.** You may stop accessing the Services at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time without notice to you if:

1. we believe that you have materially breached these Terms;
2. we must do so in order to comply with applicable law; or
3. immediate suspension or termination is necessary for security reasons and therefore we cannot provide notice.

We may also terminate your Account if you have been inactive for over a year and you do not have a paid Account. If we decide to terminate your Account due to inactivity, we will give you advance notice before doing this.

If we terminate your access to the Services due to a material violation of these Terms and you have a Subscription:

1. you will not be entitled to any refund; and
2. we may take further legal action against you and you may be responsible for our losses in relation to the violation of these Terms.

If you have a Subscription, we may terminate the Subscription immediately at any time by giving you 30 days’ notice in writing (email is sufficient). If we exercise this right, we will refund you on a pro rata basis the fees paid by you for the remaining portion of your Subscription after termination.

Upon termination of these Terms, a Subscription, or your access to the Services, the rights granted to you under our Terms (or any Subscription) to access and use our Services will immediately terminate, and we may at our option delete any Materials or other data associated with your account. Sections 6 (with respect to fees outstanding as of such expiration or termination) and 9 – 12 will survive any expiration or termination of our Terms or a Subscription.

**Severability.** Each of the sections of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining sections will remain in full force and effect.

**No waiver.** If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.

**No assignment.** These Terms may not be transferred or assigned by you without our prior written consent, but may be assigned by us without restriction.

**Use of our brand.** You may not, without our prior written permission, use our name, logos, or other trademarks in connection with products or services other than the Services, or in any other way that implies our affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship. To seek permission, please email us at marketing@anthropic.com.

**Export Controls.** You may not export or provide access to the Services into any U.S. embargoed countries or to anyone on (i) the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, (ii) any other restricted party lists identified by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, (iii) the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List, or (iv) any other restricted party lists. You agree that you and anyone accessing or using the Services on your behalf, or using your Account credentials, are not such persons or entities and are not located in any such country.

**Legal Compliance.** We may comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to provision or use of the Services, or to information provided to or collected under our Terms. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to report information from or about you, including but not limited to Inputs or Outputs, to law enforcement.

13\. In case of disputes
------------------------

**Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction.** These Terms are governed by English law. This means that your access to and use of the Website and our Services, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection therewith (including non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by English law.

You may bring any dispute which may arise under these Terms to, at your discretion, either the competent court of England, or to the competent court of your country of habitual residence if this country of habitual residence is within the UK, which courts are (with the exclusion of any other court) competent to settle any such a dispute.

We will bring any dispute which may arise under these Terms to the competent court of your country of habitual residence if this is within the UK or otherwise the competent court of England.
