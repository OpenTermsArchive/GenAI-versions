If we are relying on your consent to process your Personal Information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and free of charge. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
