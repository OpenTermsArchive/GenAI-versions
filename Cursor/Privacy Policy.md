Privacy Policy
==============

If you have any questions or feedback, please email us at [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com)!

* * *

TLDR
----

* If you enable "Privacy Mode" in Cursor's settings: zero data retention will be enabled, and none of your code will ever be stored or trained on by us or any third-party.
    
* If you enable "Privacy Mode with storage" in Cursor's settings: we may store some code data to provide extra features. None of your code will ever be trained on by us or any third-party.
    
* If you choose to keep "Privacy Mode" off, we collect telemetry, usage data, and codebase data. This includes prompts, editor actions, code snippets, files in the repository, and edits made to this code. We use this data to evaluate and improve our AI features. If you completed onboarding prior to version 0.49.0, we never store or learn from your full codebase.
    
* With "Privacy Mode" off, if you use autocomplete, [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/) (our inference provider) may also collect prompts to improve inference speed.
    

### Other notes

* Even if you use your API key, your requests will still go through our backend! That's where we do our final prompt building.
    
* If you choose to index your codebase, Cursor will upload your codebase in small chunks to our server to compute embeddings, but all plaintext code ceases to exist after the life of the request. The embeddings and metadata about your codebase (hashes, file names) may be stored in our database, but on privacy mode, none of your code is.
    
* We temporarily cache file contents on our servers to reduce latency and network usage. The files are encrypted using unique client-generated keys, and these encryption keys only exist on our servers for the duration of a request. All cached file contents are temporary, never permanently stored, and never used as training data when privacy mode is enabled.

Introduction
------------

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all visitors and users of the Cursor desktop app and websites (collectively, “Cursor,” “App” or “Apps”), which are offered by Anysphere Inc. and/or any of its affiliates (“Anysphere” or “we” or “us”) and describes how we process your personal information in connection with those Apps, and how we collect information through the use of cookies and related technologies. It also tells you how you can access and update your personal information and describes the data protection rights that may be available under your country's or state's laws. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using any part of the App, you acknowledge you have been informed of and consent to our practices with regard to your personal information and data.

Applicability of this Privacy Policy
------------------------------------

If you are a customer of Anysphere, this Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information or other data and information that we process on your behalf (if any) as your service provider (collectively, “Customer Data”). Our use of your Customer Data shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions of the separate customer agreement or terms of service that you have agreed to with us.

If you are using the Services as an employee, contractor or other representative of one of our customers and you have any questions about our privacy practices or would like to exercise any rights with respect to your personal information that we process on behalf of our customers, please contact the corresponding customer as we only process your personal information in our capacity as a service provider to our customer.

Personal information we collect
-------------------------------

You may choose to interact with our Apps in ways that provide us with your personal information. In some instances, a User ID is generated for form and URL tracking, page views, page pings and usage counts in order to ascertain product performance and development. The amount and type of information that Anysphere gathers depends on the nature of your interaction with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to share. For example, we ask visitors who use our community Discord, or our forum, to provide a username and email address. We will also collect the information you provide with us in connection with creating an account on the App. In each case, Anysphere collects such personal information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with or your request to Anysphere. We will not disclose your personal information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.

Like most website operators, Anysphere automatically collects (i) technical information about your device including your device's internet protocol (IP) address, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., WiFi, LTE, 4G), and general location information such as city, state or geographic area; and (ii) information about your visit to our Apps and online activity data (such as the referral URL, the content viewed and the content interacted with). Some of this information is collected using cookies, web beacons and related local storage technologies. See below for further information on these technologies. We collect this information to better understand how visitors use our Apps, to improve our Apps and experience for visitors, and to monitor the security of the Apps.

We may aggregate all information (including your personal information) collected from our Apps for our own statistical and analytics purposes and share such aggregated information with third parties for our own promotional purposes (e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our Apps).

Information Anysphere does not collect
--------------------------------------

Anysphere does not intentionally collect sensitive or special category personal information, such as genetic data, biometric data for the purposes of uniquely identifying a natural person, health information, or religious information.

Anysphere does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our App or content specifically to children under the age of 18. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 18, we will close that account.

How Anysphere uses and protects your personal information
---------------------------------------------------------

### Sharing your information

Anysphere may share your personal information with the third-parties listed below for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Policy or otherwise with your consent.

Anysphere only shares your personal information with those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that personal information in order to process it on Anysphere's behalf or to provide services available on the App, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

Anysphere may disclose your personal information to professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.

Anysphere may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our business or assets, including your personal information, in connection with a business transaction (or potential business transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy or dissolution. In such a case, we will make reasonable efforts to require the recipient to honor this Privacy Policy.

**Service Providers and partners.** Anysphere engages a number of service providers or partners to manage or support certain aspects of our business operations on our behalf. For instance, we currently use the following service providers who will handle your personal information:

* AWS - cloud data hosting
    
* GitHub - open source repositories and internal project management tool
    
* Datadog - application monitoring and error tracking
    
* Slack - internal communications tool
    
* Amplitude - analytics
    
* Google Workspace - internal collaboration tools
    
* Stripe - payment processing
    
* WorkOS - authentication
    

Our service providers and partners are required by contract to safeguard any personal information they receive from us and are prohibited from using the personal information for any purpose other than to perform the services as instructed by Anysphere.

**Legal Requirements.** We may disclose personal information to government authorities or other third-parties if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with a subpoena, court order or similar legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights or property, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of any App or the public, (d) protect against legal liability, (e) to investigate fraud or other unlawful activity, or (f) or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

Anysphere takes measures reasonably necessary to protect your personal information against any unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction.

Cross-border transfer of personal information
---------------------------------------------

The Apps are hosted in the United States and the personal information we collect will be stored and processed on our servers in the United States. Our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that process information for us as described above may be located in the United States or in other countries outside of your home country which may have different data protection standards to those which apply in your home country.

Where your personal information is transferred outside of the EEA, Switzerland and UK and where this is to a country which is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission or considered adequate as determined by applicable data protection laws, we will take steps to ensure your personal information is adequately protected by safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) approved by the EU Commission or by the UK Government. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be obtained for your review on request by using the contact details in the 'Contacting Anysphere About Your Privacy' section of this Privacy Policy.

Anysphere communications with you
---------------------------------

If you are a registered user of the Apps and have supplied your email address, Anysphere may occasionally send you an email to tell you about security, system information, new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Anysphere and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. You can email us at hi@cursor.com to stop receiving such emails at any time.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish your request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. We will not publish your personal information in connection with your request.

Global privacy practices and your rights
----------------------------------------

Information we collect may be stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy but we understand that users from other countries may have different expectations and rights with regard to their privacy. For all App visitors and users, no matter their country of location, we will:

* provide clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent when we do collect your personal information and where required by applicable law;
    
* only collect the minimum amount of personal information necessary for the purpose it is collected for, unless you choose to provide us more;
    
* offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting your information that we have collected, with the exception of information you voluntarily provide that is necessary to retain as is for the integrity of our project code as described further below; and
    
* provide App users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement.
    

Additional rights that may apply to you in certain instances:

* Right of data portability (if our processing is based on consent or a contract and the processing carried out by automated means);
    
* Right to withdraw consent at any time (if processing is based on consent). If you ask to withdraw your consent, this will not affect any processing which has already taken place at that time.
    
* Right to object to processing (if processing is based on legitimate interests)
    
* Right to object to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes
    
* Right of erasure of your personal data from our system (“right to be forgotten”) if certain grounds are met
    

These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.

Where we collect personal information to administer your accounts or your contract with us or to comply with our legal obligations, this is mandatory and we will not be able to manage our relationship with you without this. In all other cases, the provision of requested personal information is optional, but this may affect your ability to participate in certain App-related activities or being able to access and use certain features and services, where the information is needed for those purposes.

To exercise your privacy rights, you can email us at the address given below in the 'Contacting Anysphere About Your Privacy' section of this Privacy Policy.

Data retention and deletion
---------------------------

If you already have an account on the Apps, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by logging into your account and updating profile settings.

Anysphere will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to perform our contractual obligations, provide you services through the App, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our agreements. Retention periods will be determined taking into account the type of information that is collected and the purpose for which it is collected, bearing in mind the requirements applicable to the situation and the need to destroy outdated, unused information at the earliest reasonable opportunity. For instance, in respect of data held for the management of customers and potential customers, we consider the lead time necessary to develop and maintain our commercial relationships and how recent our interactions are with you. We may rectify, update or remove incomplete or inaccurate information, at any time and at our own discretion. For more information on our retention periods you can contact us using the details in the 'Contacting Anysphere About Your Privacy' section of this Privacy Policy.

Please note that due to the open source nature of our products, services, and community, we may retain limited personal information indefinitely in order to ensure transactional integrity and nonrepudiation. For example, if you provide your information in connection with a blog post, GitHub issue or comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts.

Contacting Anysphere About Your Privacy
