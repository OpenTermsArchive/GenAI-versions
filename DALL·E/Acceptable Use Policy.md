Usage policies
==============

_We’ve recently updated these policies. Learn more_ [_here_⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12092907)_. See previous version_ [_here_⁠](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/revisions/1/)_._

We aim for our tools to be used safely and responsibly, while maximizing your control over how you use them. In building our Usage Policies, we keep a few important things in mind.

**We empower users to innovate with AI**. We build AI products that maximize helpfulness and freedom, while ensuring safety. Usage Policies are just one way we set clear expectations for the use of our products as within a broader safety ecosystem that sets responsible guardrails across our services. You can [learn more](https://openai.com/safety/how-we-think-about-safety-alignment/) about our safety approach and [our commitment to](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-model-spec/) customizability, transparency, and intellectual freedom to explore, debate, and create with AI.

**Responsible use is a shared priority**. We assume the very best of our users. Our [terms and policies](https://openai.com/policies/)—including these Usage Policies—set a reasonable bar for acceptable use. Our rules are no substitute for legal requirements, professional duties, or ethical obligations that should influence how people use AI. We hold people accountable for appropriate use of our services, and breaking or circumventing our rules and safeguards may mean you lose access to our systems or experience other penalties.

**We build with safety first**. We [monitor and enforce](https://openai.com/transparency-and-content-moderation/) policies with privacy safeguards in place and clear review processes. We give developers practical [moderation tools⁠(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation) and guidance so they can support their end users. We [publish](https://openai.com/safety/) what our systems can and can’t do, share [research](https://openai.com/research/index/) and [updates](https://openai.com/news/), and provide a simple way to [report misuse](https://openai.com/form/report-content/).

**We update as we learn**. People are using our systems in new ways every day, and we update our rules to ensure they are not overly restrictive or to better protect our users. We reserve all rights to withhold access where we reasonably believe it necessary to protect our service or users or anyone else. You can [appeal⁠](https://openai.com/transparency-and-content-moderation/#:~:text=determining%20enforcement%20actions.-,Appeals%20process,-If%20we%20take) if you think we have made a mistake enforcing policy, and we will work to make things right.

**Your use of OpenAI services must follow these Usage Policies:**

* **Protect people**. Everyone has a right to safety and security. So you cannot use our services for:
    * threats, intimidation, harassment, or defamation
    * suicide, self-harm, or disordered eating promotion or facilitation
    * sexual violence or non-consensual intimate content
    * terrorism or violence, including hate-based violence

    * unsolicited safety testing
    * circumventing our safeguards

* **Respect privacy**. People are entitled to privacy. So, we don’t allow attempts to compromise the privacy of others, including to aggregate, monitor, profile, or distribute individuals’ private or sensitive information without their authorization. And, you may never use our services for:
    * facial recognition databases without data subject consent
    * real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces
    * use of someone’s likeness, including their photorealistic image or voice, without their consent in ways that could confuse authenticity

    * inference regarding an individual’s emotions in the workplace and educational settings, except when necessary for medical or safety reasons
    * assessment or prediction of the risk of an individual committing a criminal offense based solely on their personal traits or on profiling
* **Keep minors safe**. Children and teens deserve special protection. Our services are designed to prevent harm and support their well-being, and must never be used to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under 18 years old. [We report](https://openai.com/index/combating-online-child-sexual-exploitation-abuse/) apparent child sexual abuse material and child endangerment to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. We prohibit use of our services for:  
    * child sexual abuse material (CSAM), whether or not any portion is AI generated 
    * grooming of minors
    * exposing minors to age-inappropriate content, such as graphic self-harm, sexual, or violent content
    * promoting unhealthy dieting or exercise behavior to minors
    * shaming or otherwise stigmatizing the body type or appearance of minors
    * dangerous challenges for minors
    * underaged sexual or violent roleplay
    * underaged access to age-restricted goods or activities
* **Empower people**. People should be able to make decisions about their lives and their communities. So we don’t allow our services to be used to manipulate or deceive people, to interfere with their exercise of human rights, to exploit people’s vulnerabilities, or to interfere with their ability to get an education or access critical services, including any use for:
    * academic dishonesty
    * deceit, fraud, scams, spam, or impersonation
    * political campaigning, lobbying, foreign or domestic election interference, or demobilization activities
    * automation of high-stakes decisions in sensitive areas without human review
        * critical infrastructure
        * education
        * housing
        * employment

        * migration
        * law enforcement
