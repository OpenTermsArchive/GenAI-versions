We may use Personal Data for the following purposes:

* To provide and maintain our Services;
    
* To improve and develop our Services and new features and conduct research;
    
* To communicate with you, including to send you information or marketing about our Services and events;

Read [our instructions⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance) on how you can opt out of our use of your Content to train our models.

4\. Disclosure of Personal Data
-------------------------------

In certain circumstances we may disclose your Personal Data to:

* _Vendors and Service Providers_: To assist us in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services and functions, we may disclose Personal Data to vendors and service providers, including providers of hosting services, customer service vendors, cloud services, content delivery services, data warehouse services, support and safety monitoring services, email communication software, web analytics services, payment and transaction providers, and other information technology services providers. Pursuant to our instructions, these parties will access, process, or store Personal Data only in the course of performing their duties to us.
    
* _Business Transfers_: If we are involved in strategic transactions, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, or transition of service to another provider (collectively, a “Transaction”), your Personal Data and other information may be disclosed in the diligence process with counterparties and others assisting with the Transaction and transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that Transaction along with other assets.
    
* _Government Authorities or Other Third Parties_: We may share your Personal Data, including information about your interaction with our Services, with government authorities, industry peers, or other third parties in compliance with the law (i) if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) if we determine, in our sole discretion, that there is a violation of our terms, policies, or the law; (iv) to detect or prevent fraud or other illegal activity; (v) to protect the safety, security, and integrity of our products, employees, or users, or the public, or (vi) to protect against legal liability.

* _Business Account Administrators_: When you join a ChatGPT Enterprise or business account, the administrator of that account may access and control your OpenAI account. In addition, if you create an account using an email address belonging to your employer or organization, we may share the fact that you have an account and certain account information, such as your email address, with your employer or organization to, for example, enable you to be added to their business account.
    

_Other Users and Third Parties You Share Information With_: Certain features allow you to display or share information with other users. For example, you may share ChatGPT conversations with other users via shared links or send information to third-party applications via custom actions for GPTs.

5\. Retention
-------------

We’ll retain your Personal Data for only as long as we need in order to provide our Service to you, or for other legitimate business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety and security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations. How long we retain Personal Data will depend on a number of factors, such as:

* Our purpose for processing the data (such as whether we need to retain the data to provide our Services);
    
* The amount, nature, and sensitivity of the data;
    
* The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the data;
    
* Any legal requirements that we are subject to.
    

In some cases, the length of time we retain data depends on your settings. For example, ChatGPT’s data controls offer you the ability to turn off chat history. When chat history is disabled, the conversation will not appear in your history and we will permanently delete new conversations after 30 days and review them only as needed to monitor for and investigate abuse. You can find more information on data controls [here⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7730893-data-controls-faq).

6\. Your rights
---------------

You have the following statutory rights in relation to your Personal Data:

* Access your Personal Data and information relating to how it is processed.
    
* Delete your Personal Data from our records.
    
* Rectify or update your Personal Data.
    
* Transfer your Personal Data to a third party (right to data portability).
    
* Restrict how we process your Personal Data.
    
* Withdraw your consent—where we rely on consent as the legal basis for processing at any time. 
    
* Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority (see below). 
    

You have the following rights to object:

* Object to our processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing at any time. 
    
* Object to how we process your Personal Data when our processing is based on our legitimate interests.
    

You can exercise some of these rights through your OpenAI account. If you are unable to exercise your rights through your account, please submit your request through [privacy.openai.com⁠(opens in a new window)](https://privacy.openai.com/) or send it to [dsar@openai.com⁠](mailto:dsar@openai.com).

Please note these rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal Personal Data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information that we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.   

We hope that we are able to address any questions or concerns you may have. If you have any unresolved complaints with us or our Data Protection Officer, you can reach out to the [Irish Data Protection Commissioner⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.dataprotection.ie/) as our lead supervisory authority, or [your local supervisory authority⁠(opens in a new window)](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en). For any unresolved complaints relating to the UK you can reach out to the [Information Commissioner's Office⁠(opens in a new window)](https://ico.org.uk/) and for Switzerland, to the [Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner⁠(opens in a new window)](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).   

* A note about accuracy: Services like ChatGPT generate responses by reading a user’s request and, in response, predicting the words most likely to appear next. In some cases, the words most likely to appear next may not be the most factually accurate. For this reason, you should not rely on the factual accuracy of output from our models. If you notice that ChatGPT output contains factually inaccurate information about you and you would like us to correct the inaccuracy, you may submit a correction request to [dsar@openai.com⁠](mailto:dsar@openai.com). Given the technical complexity of how our models work, we may not be able to correct the inaccuracy in every instance. In that case, you may request that we remove your Personal Data from ChatGPT’s output by filling out [this form⁠(opens in a new window)](https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30).
    

For information on how to exercise your rights with respect to data we have collected from the internet to train our models, please see this [notice⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7842364-how-chatgpt-and-our-language-models-are-developed).

7\. Children
------------

Our Services are not directed to, or intended for, children under 13.  We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If you have reason to believe that a child under 13 has provided Personal Data to OpenAI through the Services, please email us at [privacy@openai.com⁠](mailto:privacy@openai.com).
