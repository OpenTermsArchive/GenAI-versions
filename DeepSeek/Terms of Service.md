1.**Services**
--------------

1.1 DeepSeek's products and services include those provided to you through websites, applications (which may include different versions), software development kits (SDKs) for third-party websites and applications, application programming interfaces (APIs), and innovative forms that emerge with technological development. These encompass platforms with generative artificial intelligence services at their core, among other functionalities (hereinafter referred to as "the Services").

1.2 The generative AI products and services provided by DeepSeek are based on large language models, which are built using neural network, developed through stages of large-scale self-supervised pre-training and targeted optimization training. These models can predict the next token by encoding and computing the input information(including text, images, files, and more), thereby possessing text generation and conversational abilities. They are adept at performing a wide range of text generation tasks and can be integrated into various downstream systems or applications. Specifically, within DeepSeek's product services, these models, based on user input information (referred to as "Inputs"), compute and infer to output corresponding content as a response (referred to as "Outputs" ), including text, tables, and code. Users can evaluate the output, including actions like liking or disliking, to provide feedback on their opinions about DeepSeek's output information.

1.3 As generative artificial intelligence technology, models, and products continue to evolve, along with changes in laws and regulations, we may add, upgrade, modify, suspend, or terminate services, or make necessary adjustments to the technology, method, and performance of the services, and may conduct internal or external testing for new service features.
