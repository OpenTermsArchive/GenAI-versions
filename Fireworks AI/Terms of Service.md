1. **How We Administer the Service**

**1.1 Eligibility.** This is a contract between you and Fireworks. You must read and agree to these Terms before using the Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You may use the Service only if you can form a legally binding contract with us, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations (“**Applicable Law**”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any access to, or use of, the Service by anyone who is a minor (which is under the age of 18 in most jurisdictions) in any applicable jurisdiction (a “**Minor**”) is strictly prohibited and in violation of these Terms, unless such access and/or use is supervised by a parent or legal guardian (“**Parent**”) who: (a) has read and understands these Terms; (b) approves all rights granted, and all obligations undertaken, by the Minor hereunder; and (c) agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are a Parent of a User who is a Minor, then, by allowing such Minor to access and/or use the Service, you are subject to these Terms and responsible for such Minor’s activity on the Service. With respect to the Parent of a User who is a Minor, “you,” as used in these Terms in the context of a license grant, assignment, restriction, obligation, acknowledgment, representation, warranty, or covenant, or in any similar context, means “the Parent, on behalf of the Parent and the Minor,” and “your” has the corresponding meaning. The Service is not available to any Users we previously removed from the Service.

**1.2 User Accounts**

a) Your User Account. Your account on the Service (your “**User Account**”) gives you access to certain services and functionalities that we may, in our sole discretion, establish and maintain as part of the Service from time to time. You acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you do not own your User Account, nor do you possess any rights to data stored by or on behalf of Fireworks on the servers running the Service. We may maintain different types of User Accounts for different types of Users.

b) Organizational Accounts. An individual may access and/or use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity, such as that individual’s employer (such entity, an “**Organization**”). In such cases, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein: (a) these Terms are an agreement between (i) us and such individual and (ii) us and that Organization; (b) “you,” as used in these Terms in the context of a license grant, assignment, restriction, obligation, acknowledgment, representation, warranty, or covenant, or in any similar context, means (i) such individual _**and**_ (ii) “the Organization, on behalf of the Organization and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, and other representatives who access and/or use the Service (collectively, “**Org Users**”)”; and “your” has the corresponding meanings; (c) such individual represents and warrants to having the authority to bind that Organization to these Terms (and, in the absence of such authority, such individual may not access, nor use, the Service); (d) such individual’s acceptance of these Terms will bind that Organization to these Terms; (e) we may disclose information regarding such individual and such individual’s access to and use of the Service to that Organization; (f) such individual’s right to access and use the Service may be suspended or terminated (and the administration of the applicable User Account may be transferred) if such individual ceases to be associated with, or ceases to use an email address associated with or provisioned by, that Organization; (g) that Organization will make all Org Users aware of these Terms’ provisions, as applicable to such Org Users, and will cause each Org User to comply with such provisions; and (h) that Organization will be solely responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of the Org Users, and any act or omission by any Org User that would constitute a breach of these Terms had it been taken by that Organization will be deemed a breach of these Terms by that Organization. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if an individual opens a User Account using an email address associated with or provisioned by an Organization, or if an Organization pays fees due in connection with such individual’s access to or use of the Service (or reimburses such individual for payment of such fees), then we may, in our sole discretion, deem such individual to be accessing and using the Service on behalf of that Organization.

c) Connecting Via Third-Party Services. By connecting to the Service via a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service, as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials and/or access tokens for that service.

d) Account Security. You may never use another User’s User Account without such User’s permission. When creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your User Account, you will keep your User Account password(s) and/or any other authentication credentials secure, and you will not share your password(s) and/or any other authentication credentials with anyone else. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols) to protect your User Account. We will not be liable for, and expressly disclaim liability for, any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your User Account and/or any changes to your User Account, including, without limitation, changes made by any Org User with administrator-level access to your User Account. You will notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your User Account.

e) Notifications; Emails. By providing us with your email address, you consent to our using that email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by Applicable Law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.

**1.3 Changes, Suspension, and Termination.** You may de-activate your User Account at any time. We may, with or without prior notice, change the Service, stop providing the Service or features of the Service to you or to Users generally, or create usage limits for the Service. We may, with or without prior notice, permanently terminate or temporarily suspend your access to your User Account and/or the Service without liability, with or without cause, and for any or no reason, including if, in our sole determination, you violate any provision of these Terms. Upon their termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by these Terms.

**8.1 Billing Policies; Taxes.** Certain aspects of the Service may be provided for free, while certain other aspects of the Service and/or products available on the Service may be provided for a fee or other charge (“**Fee**”). Each Fee (including each Subscription Fee (as defined below)) is the sum of the applicable Fireworks Fee (as defined below) and any applicable Third-Party Fees (as defined below). By electing to use non-free aspects of the Service, including enrolling in Subscription(s) (as defined below), you agree to the pricing and payment terms applicable to you and available at [https://readme.fireworks.ai/page/pricing](https://readme.fireworks.ai/page/pricing) (as we may update them from time to time, the “**Pricing and Payment Terms**”). The Pricing and Payment Terms are hereby incorporated by reference herein. We may add new products and/or services for additional Fees, add or amend Fees for existing products and/or services, and/or discontinue offering any Subscriptions at any time, in our sole discretion; provided, however, that if we have agreed to a specific Subscription Term and a corresponding Subscription Fee, then that Subscription will remain in force for that Subscription Fee during that Subscription Term. Any change to the Pricing and Payment Terms will become effective in the billing cycle following our provision of notice of such change. Except as may be expressly stated in these Terms or in the Pricing and Payment Terms, all Fees must be paid in advance, payment obligations are non-cancelable once incurred (subject to any cancellation rights set forth in these Terms), and Fees paid are non-refundable. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use, and withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, but, for clarity, excluding taxes based on our net income, “**Taxes**”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your purchases and/or Subscriptions in connection with the Service.

**8.2 Definitions**

a) “**Subscription**” means a particular portion of the Service that is available on an automatically renewing subscription basis, and your access thereto, as applicable.

b) “**Subscription Fee**” means the recurring amount due as consideration for a Subscription; a Subscription Fee is one type of Fee.

c) “**Fireworks Fee**” means the portion of the Fee (including any Subscription Fee) that Fireworks may retain as consideration for providing the Service or any portion thereof (including any particular Subscription), as applicable.

**8.3 Your Payment Method**

a) General. To use non-free aspects of the Service, you must provide us with at least one (1) current, valid payment card that is accepted by us and Payment Processor (each such card, a “**Payment Method**”). By providing a Payment Method, you authorize each of Fireworks and Payment Processor to charge that Payment Method the applicable Fees and Taxes, including, if applicable, on a recurring basis until you cancel your Subscription (including any notice period specified in Section 8.4(c) (Cancellation Procedures)). Fees and Taxes will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated in your User Account. In some cases, your payment date may change, for example, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, if you changed your Subscription plan, or if your Subscription began on a date not contained in a subsequent month. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of Subscription in which you are enrolled, if applicable. Fees are fully earned upon payment. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of Service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to one (1) month of service as soon as you register for the Service.

b) Third-Party Payment Processor. We or Payment Processor will attempt to verify your Payment Method(s), and may do so by processing an authorization hold, which is standard practice. To the extent Payment Processor processes payments made by you, you will be subject to terms and conditions governing the use of Payment Processor’s service. Please review such terms and conditions as well as Payment Processor’s privacy notice (each of which is available on Payment Processor’s website). You acknowledge and understand that Payment Processor may collect and retain Third-Party Fees whenever you pay Fees (including Subscription Fees). Payment must be received by Payment Processor before our acceptance of an order. We do not view or store your full credit card or other Payment Method information. For all payments, Payment Processor will collect your Payment Method details and charge your chosen Payment Method in connection with an order. If any of your account, order, or Payment Method information changes, you will promptly update such information, so that we or Payment Processor may complete your transaction(s) and/or contact you, as needed.

c) Payment Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that: (i) the account, order, and Payment Method information you supply to us and/or to Payment Processor, as applicable, is true, accurate, correct, and complete; (ii) you are duly authorized to use the Payment Method(s); (iii) you will pay any and all charges incurred by users of your Payment Method in connection with the Service, including any applicable Fees (at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred) and Taxes; (iv) charges incurred by you will be honored by your Payment Method company; (v) you will not allow or enable anyone else to use your Subscription (including, without limitation, by sharing your password(s) or any other authentication credentials with anyone else, or by attempting to transfer your Subscription to anyone else); and (vi) you will report to us any unauthorized or prohibited access to or use of your Subscription and/or password(s) or other authentication credentials.

d) Disclaimer. WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO, AND YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR: (I) ANY SECURITY OR PRIVACY BREACHES RELATED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD, (II) ANY FEES THAT MAY BE CHARGED TO YOU BY YOUR BANK IN CONNECTION WITH THE COLLECTION OF FEES, AND/OR (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR CREDIT CARD, DEBIT CARD, OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD BY A THIRD PARTY.

If you use a third-party service in connection with the service, you are subject to and agree to, and must comply with, the third party’s terms and conditions made available via, or agreed in connection with, its services. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any third-party services.

You expressly relieve us from any and all liability arising from your access to and/or use of any third-party service.

**11\. Release**

You hereby release us from all claims, damages (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or otherwise), obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, debts, and expenses, in each case of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of a dispute between you and a third party (including any other User) in connection with the Service. In addition, you waive any Applicable Law that says, in substance: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE RELEASED PARTY.”

**12\. Indemnity**

You will defend, indemnify, and hold us and our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our and their respective agents, suppliers, licensors, employees, contractors, officers, and directors (collectively, including Fireworks, the “**Fireworks Indemnitees**”) harmless from and against any and all claims, damages (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or otherwise), obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, debts, and expenses (including, but not limited to, legal fees) arising from: (a) your access to and/or use of the Service, including your use of any Output;; (b) your violation of any term of these Terms, including, without limitation, your breach of any of your representations and warranties set forth in these Terms; (c) your violation of any third-party right, including, without limitation, any privacy right or Intellectual Property Right; (d) your violation of any Applicable Law; (e) User Content or any content that is submitted via your User Account, including, without limitation, any misleading, false, or inaccurate information; (f) your willful misconduct; or (g) any third party’s access to and/or use of the Service with your username(s), password(s), or other authentication credential(s).

**13\. No Warranty; Disclaimers**

The service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Your use of the service is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the service, the intellectual property, and any other information available on or through the service are provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and/or non-infringement. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through the service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Fireworks indemnitees warrants that any content or any other information contained in, or available via, the service is accurate, comprehensive, reliable, useful, or correct; that the service will meet your requirements; that the service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted, or secure; that any defects or errors in the service will be corrected; or that the service is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the service is so obtained at your own risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system(s) or mobile device(s) and/or for loss of data that results from same or from your access to and/or use of the service. You may have other statutory rights, but the duration of statutorily required warranties, if any, will be limited to the shortest period permitted by applicable law.

Further, Fireworks does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, recommend, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by any third party through the service or any hyperlinked website or service, and Fireworks will not be a party to, or in any way monitor, any transaction between you and third-party providers of products or services.

United States federal law and some states, provinces, and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of and/or limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above exclusions and/or limitations may not apply to you. These terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations under these terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

**14\. Limitation of Liability**

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any Fireworks indemnitee be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the service or any portion thereof. Under no circumstances will we be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access to or use of the service or your user account or the information contained therein.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we assume no liability or responsibility for any (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of the service; (c) any unauthorized access to or use of the servers running the service and/or any and all personal information stored therein; (d) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the service; (e) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the service by any third party; (f) any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the service; and/or (g) your data, any user content, or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.

In no event will any Fireworks indemnitee be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to us hereunder or one hundred U.S. Dollars ($100.00), whichever is greater. This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damage.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of and/or limitations on incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions and/or limitations may not apply to you. These terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under these terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

**15\. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**

**15.1 Governing Law.** You agree that: (a) the Service will be deemed solely based in the State of Delaware; and (b) the Service will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Delaware. These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law governing these Terms, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be amended, “**FAA**”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement below and preempts all state laws (and laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under and governed by the law of the U.S. state where you live (if applicable) or the jurisdiction mutually agreed upon in writing by you and us. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Confidential Information, or Intellectual Property Rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Delaware is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award, or for trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration Agreement below is found to be unenforceable. These Terms were drafted in the English language and this English language version of the Terms is the original, governing instrument of the understanding between you and us. In the event of any conflict between the English version of these Terms and any translation, the English version will prevail.

**15.2 Arbitration Agreement**

a) General. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, and enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a User or consumer (each, a “**Claim**,” and, collectively, “**Claims**”). This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Terms.

b) Opting Out of Arbitration Agreement. If you are a new User, you can reject and opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms by emailing us at [support@fireworks.ai](mailto:support@fireworks.ai) with your full, legal name and stating your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.

c) Dispute-Resolution Process. For any Claim, you will first contact us at [support@fireworks.ai](mailto:support@fireworks.ai) and attempt to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve such Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by JAMS before a single arbitrator (the “**Arbitrator**”), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the “**Rules**”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/), where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live (if applicable) or Sussex County, Delaware, unless you and Fireworks agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing and administrative fees and Arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this would not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are, or whether any provision of these Terms is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.

d) Equitable Relief. NOTHING IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT, PROVIDED THAT YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.

e) Severability. If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

**15.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.** BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FIREWORKS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. THE FOREGOING APPLIES TO ALL USERS (BOTH NATURAL PERSONS AND ENTITIES), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES. THIS CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS. YOU AND FIREWORKS AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.

**16\. U.S. Government Restricted Rights**

To the extent the Service is being used by or on behalf of the U.S. Government, the Service will be deemed commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation (as applicable). Accordingly, if you are an agency of the U.S. Government or any contractor therefor, you receive only those rights with respect to the Service as are granted to all other Users hereunder, in accordance with 48 C.F.R. §227.7202 and 48 C.F.R. §12.212, as applicable.

You understand and acknowledge that the Service may be subject to export control laws and regulations. You will comply with all applicable import and export and re-export control and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“**OFAC**”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. State Department. You represent and warrant that you are not, and that no person to whom you make the Service available or that is acting on your behalf, or, if you are an Organization, that no person or entity owning 50% or more of your equity securities or other equivalent voting interests, is (a) listed on the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons or on any other list of sanctioned, prohibited, or restricted parties administered by OFAC or by any other governmental entity, or (b) located in, a national or resident of, or a segment of the government of, any country or territory for which the United States maintains trade or economic sanctions or embargoes or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” region.

**18\. General Provisions**

**18.2 Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms.** We may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by Applicable Law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice or written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on the Service, as we determine, at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification, as required under Applicable Law or as described in these Terms. We are not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the top of this page and notify you that material changes have been made to these Terms. These Terms apply to and govern your access to and use of the Service effective as of the start of your access to the Service, even if such access began before publication of these Terms. Your continued use of the Service after any change to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any part of these Terms or to any future Terms of Service, do not access or use (or continue to access or use) the Service.

**18.3 Entire Agreement; Severability.** These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with us in connection with the Service, will constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the Service. Any statements or comments made between you and any of our employees or representatives are expressly excluded from these Terms and will not apply to you or us, or to your access to or use of the Service. Except as otherwise stated in the Arbitration Agreement, if any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect.

**18.4 No Waiver.** No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or of any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting it in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (916) 445-1254.
