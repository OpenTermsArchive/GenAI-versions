GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features
=================================================

Version Effective Date: September 5, 2023

When you use GitHub, you may be given access to lots of additional products and features ("Additional Products and Features"). Because many of the Additional Products and Features offer different functionality, your Agreement with us (the "Agreement") includes the specific terms for that product or feature combined with your main agreement — the GitHub Terms of Service or GitHub Customer Agreement, or the GitHub Corporate Terms of Service or other legacy GitHub contract, or a Microsoft volume licensing agreement. Below, we've listed those products and features, along with the corresponding additional terms that apply to your use of them.

By using the Additional Products and Features, you also agree to the applicable GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features listed below. A violation of these GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features is a violation of the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning given in the Agreement.

**For Enterprise users**

* **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Codespaces, Dependabot Preview, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Packages, and Pages.
    
* **GitHub Enterprise Server** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Connect, Dependabot Preview, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Packages, Pages, and SQL Server Images.
    

[GitHub Copilot](#github-copilot)
---------------------------------

To use GitHub Copilot, you need to install an extension to an integrated development environment (IDE) or editor. The code you write using the GitHub Copilot extension in an IDE or editor (“**Your Code**”) is not “Content” under the Agreement until you upload it to GitHub.com.

The code, functions, and other output returned to you by GitHub Copilot are called “**Suggestions**.” GitHub does not claim any rights in Suggestions, and you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Code, including Suggestions you include in Your Code.

_Acceptable Use_

Your Code is subject to the GitHub [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies). For example, you may not prompt GitHub Copilot with content that is unlawful or otherwise prohibited by the GitHub Acceptable Use Policies on GitHub.com.

_Data_

GitHub Copilot (i) may, depending on your preferred telemetry settings, collect snippets of Your Code, and (ii) will collect additional usage information through the IDE or editor tied to your Account. This may include personal data, as referenced in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement). You can learn more about the collection and use of GitHub Copilot data in the [GitHub Copilot FAQ](https://github.com/features/copilot#faq-privacy-copilot-for-individuals).

For GitHub Copilot for Business users, your use of GitHub Copilot is governed by the [GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-copilot-product-specific-terms).
