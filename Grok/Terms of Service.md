**Minimum age.** You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum age required in your country to use the Service, and you must confirm that you meet the minimum age requirement. If you are a teenager between the ages of 13 and 17 years old, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use the Service, and they must agree to our Terms of Service. While we have taken measures to limit undesirable training data and outputs, depending on the features that you choose to use, the Service could produce output that is not appropriate for all ages. For instance, if users choose certain features or input suggestive or coarse language, the Service may respond with some dialogue that may involve coarse language, crude humor, sexual situations, or violence. We urge parents to exercise care in monitoring the use of the Service by their teenagers. Parents or guardians who choose to use certain features of the Service to aid in their interactions with their children, including regarding educational, enlightening, or entertaining discussions they have with their children, must make use of the data controls provided in the Service to select the appropriate features for their needs.

**Third-party services and software.** Our Service may include or be integrated with third-party software, products, or services that are subject to their own terms. Our software may include open source software that is governed by its own licenses.

[**User Content**](#user-content)
---------------------------------

**You Own Your User Content.** You may provide input (e.g., text, audio, images, video, code, files, folders, drives, etc.) to the Service (”**Input**”) and receive output from the Service based on the Input (”**Output**”). Collectively, Input and Output are “**User Content**.” You are responsible for User Content, including ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions needed to provide Input to our Service. To the extent permitted by applicable law, and as between you and xAI, you retain your ownership rights to the User Content. We ask that when using Output, you attribute the Service as having generated the Output, as detailed in our [Brand Guidelines](https://x.ai/legal/brand-guidelines).

**Our Use of User Content.** You grant, an irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, and worldwide right to xAI to use, copy, store, modify, distribute, reproduce, publish, display in public forums, list information regarding, make derivative works of, and aggregate your User Content and derivative works thereof for any purpose, including but not limited: (i) to maintain and provide the Service; (ii) to improve our products and the Service and for our other business purposes, such as data analysis, customer and market research, developing new products or features, or identifying or displaying usage or User Content trends; and (iii) to perform such other actions to enforce these Terms, comply with our Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, or keep our Service safe.

Automated systems that analyze your use of the Service and User Content may be used for business, safety, and compliance purposes. A limited number of our authorized personnel may review how you use the Service and your User Content for specific business purposes, including improving product features, investigating security incidents and potential misuse of our Services, and complying with our legal obligations.

**Electing whether your User Content is used for product development or model training.** When logged into our Service, you can select whether or not you want us to use your User Content to improve our products and services and train our models. Private Chat and User Content that you request to be deleted will be queued for deletion, which may take up to 30 days. Where available, you may access our Service without logging in; when doing so, where permitted, you grant us full rights to use any data you provide to or obtain from our Service for product development and model training purposes. Further details are available in our [Privacy Policy](https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy) and [Consumer FAQs](https://x.ai/legal/faq).

**Accuracy.** Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and is probabilistic in nature; therefore, it may sometimes: a) result in Output that contains “hallucinations,” b) be offensive, c) not accurately reflect real people, places or facts, or d) be objectionable, inappropriate, or otherwise not suitable for your intended purpose.

**Similarity of content.** Due to the nature of artificial intelligence, outputs may not be unique, and different users may receive similar output from our Service. Your rights to the Output do not extend to other’s rights.

**Connecting to third-party services.** Certain features of the Service may facilitate your ability to connect to a third-party service, such as X or other companies. If you select a feature that involves sending your User Content to such a third-party service, you are instructing and authorizing xAI to send your User Content out of the Service. Please review the policies of any third-party service providers for additional information about how they may use those materials.

**When you use our Service, you understand and agree that:**

* Output may not always be accurate. Output from our services is not professional advice. You should conduct your own thorough research and should not rely on Output as the truth.
* You are responsible for evaluating the Output for accuracy and appropriateness for your use, including using human review and supervision, before using or sharing Output.
* Our Service may provide incomplete, incorrect, or offensive Output that does not represent xAI’s views. Outputs are not meant to endorse a person or third-party’s views.
* At our sole discretion, we may implement rate limitations to accommodate system resources or usage needs.
