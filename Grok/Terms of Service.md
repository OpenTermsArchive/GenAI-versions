[**User Content**](#user-content)
---------------------------------

**You Own Your User Content.** You may provide input (e.g., text, audio, images, video, code, files, folders, drives, etc.) to the Service (”**Input**”) and receive output from the Service (excluding output from Grokipedia) based on the Input (”**Output**”). Collectively, Input and Output are “**User Content**.” You are responsible for User Content, including ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions needed to provide Input to our Service. To the extent permitted by applicable law, and as between you and xAI, you retain your ownership rights to the User Content. You are responsible and accept liability for the User Content. We ask that when using Output, you attribute the Service as having generated the Output, as detailed in our [Brand Guidelines](https://x.ai/legal/brand-guidelines).

**Our Use of User Content.** You grant, an irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, and worldwide right to xAI to use, copy, store, modify, distribute, reproduce, publish, display in public forums, list information regarding, make derivative works of, and aggregate your User Content and derivative works thereof for any purpose, including but not limited: (i) to maintain and provide the Service; (ii) to improve our products and the Service and for our other business purposes, such as data analysis, customer and market research, developing new products or features, or identifying or displaying usage or User Content trends; and (iii) to perform such other actions to enforce these Terms, comply with our Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, or keep our Service safe.

Automated systems that analyze your use of the Service and User Content may be used for business, safety, and compliance purposes. A limited number of our authorized personnel may review how you use the Service and your User Content for specific business purposes, including improving product features, investigating security incidents and potential misuse of our Service, and complying with our legal obligations.

**Electing whether your User Content is used for product development or model training.** When logged into our Service, you can select whether or not you want us to use your User Content to improve our products and services and train our models. Private Chat and User Content that you request to be deleted will be queued for deletion, which may take up to 30 days.

Further details are available in our [Privacy Policy](https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy) and [Consumer FAQs](https://x.ai/legal/faq).

**Accuracy.** Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and is probabilistic in nature; therefore, it may sometimes: a) result in Output that contains “hallucinations,” b) be offensive, c) not accurately reflect real people, places or facts, or d) be objectionable, inappropriate, or otherwise not suitable for your intended purpose.

**Similarity of content.** Due to the nature of artificial intelligence, outputs may not be unique, and different users may receive similar output from our Service. Your rights to the Output do not extend to other's rights.

**Grokipedia License**. Grokipedia content and material is designated as Material subject to the xAI Community License Agreement ([https://huggingface.co/xai-org/grok-2/blob/main/LICENSE](https://huggingface.co/xai-org/grok-2/blob/main/LICENSE)). Certain Grokipedia content may also be subject to [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en) ("CC BY-SA 4.0").

**Connecting to third-party services.** Certain features of the Service may facilitate your ability to connect to a third-party service, such as X or other companies. If you select a feature that involves sending your User Content to such a third-party service, you are instructing and authorizing xAI to send your User Content out of the Service. Please review the policies of any third-party service providers for additional information about how they may use those materials.

**When you use our Service, you understand and agree that:**

* Output may not always be accurate. Output from our services is not professional advice. You should conduct your own thorough research and should not rely on Output as the truth.
* You are responsible for evaluating the Output for accuracy and appropriateness for your use, including using human review and supervision, before using or sharing Output.
* Our Service may provide incomplete, incorrect, or offensive Output that does not represent xAI's views. Outputs are not meant to endorse a person or third-party's views.
* At our sole discretion, we may implement rate limitations to accommodate system resources or usage needs.
