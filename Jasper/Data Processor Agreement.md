In such an event, the Parties agree to discuss commercial reasonable alternative solutions in good faith. If the parties cannot reach a resolution within sixty (60) days from the date of Processor’s receipt of Customer’s written objection, Customer may discontinue the use of the affected Services by providing written notice to Processor. In the absence of timely and valid objection by Customer, such new Sub-processor may be commissioned to Process Controller Data.

‍**Schedule 2 – Technical and Organizational Security Measures**

**Organization Security**

**Personnel**

Security of the Jasper environment is the responsibility of all Jasper employees, contractors, and temporary workers who have access to Jasper information systems. All personnel are required to understand and follow program policies and processes.

Before access is granted, all personnel are required to review the employee handbook, sign a confidentiality agreement, and have security training. Training and agreements cover among other elements: privacy, information security, physical security, acceptable use, and incident reporting. Upon termination of employment or contract, all access is removed promptly.

**Security and Awareness Training**

During the onboarding process all employees are given information security and privacy training. They are also required to receive that training annually and acknowledge that they have read and understand Jasper information security policies.

Some technical teams require elevated access to information systems to perform their job duties. These teams receive annual specialized training specific to those roles and responsibilities. All employees are required to report potential security and privacy related issues to the appropriate internal teams. They acknowledge that failure to do so may result in disciplinary measures up to and including termination.

**Complying with Laws and Regulations**

Jasper works with legal representation that ensures the company and its employees identify and follow applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. Jasper requires all personnel to behave ethically and to comply with the law.

**SDLC**

Jasper utilizes an effective secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) including requirements like code must be reviewed and approved before being pushed into production. This program covers feature enhancements, bug fixes, emergency changes, and problem and incident management. The agile nature of the process allows for teams to follow their own release cycles and provides continuous improvement without having other teams creating a bottleneck.

All code is checked into a version control repository with role based access controls. The Jasper code repository is controlled by strong authentication, including MFA.

**Penetration Testing**

Jasper engages independent 3rd parties to conduct annual penetration tests. Results of these tests are shared with management. An overview of the results may be shared with customers upon request. The Jasper information security team reviews and prioritizes findings and tracks them to resolution. Customers are not allowed to conduct their own penetration tests of the Jasper environment. Any exceptions must have written approval from the Jasper VP of Engineering.

**Technical Controls - Protecting Jasper Customer Data**

**Data Encryption**

Jasper encrypts data at rest and in transit using industry best practices. All information transmitted to users is done via HTTPS using TLS 1.2 or higher with AES 256 SHA2 signatures (defaulting to TLS 1.3 based on client ability). Data at rest is encrypted at the storage level using AES256. Database connections are verified using TLS certificates, and encrypted in transit using SSL.

**Password Security**

Jasper uses industry leading services to securely authenticate users. Passwords are hashed and salted using BCrypt or equivalent (a one way hashing algorithm with high entropy) that is designed to be secure and mitigate against user database breach/theft. User passwords are never stored in plaintext.

**Cloud Provider**

Jasper utilizes serverless instances across multiple cloud providers to ensure High Availability of all services. Cloudflare CDN is used to provide faster access to Jasper’s application as well as to help prevent DDOS attacks. Cloudflare WAF is used to protect against commonly known web application vulnerabilities.

**Authorization**

All access to Jasper systems is based on a least privilege model; meaning personnel are only granted the access that they need to perform their current job responsibilities. Reviews of access are done on at least an annual basis. When personnel are terminated their access is removed immediately.

**System Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting**

Jasper has a centralized log management system which facilitates logging, correlation and monitoring of network, operating system, and database logs. Centralized logging is enabled for all production systems.

These logs are reviewed for indications of compromise and alerted upon when predetermined thresholds are met. The Information Security team is responsible for incident handling when monitoring and alerting thresholds are reached and tracks the security events through to remediation or escalation. Production infrastructure is also monitored to ensure availability. Jasper maintains an incident response plan to effectively respond to any deviation from normal system performance.

**Endpoint Security**

Jasper endpoints are managed by industry standard management tools to ensure policies are followed and systems stay up to date with all relevant security patches.

**Vulnerability Management**

Reported vulnerabilities are remediated promptly following industry best practices. Production systems are monitored for vulnerabilities, and operating systems are refreshed regularly to stay current.

The Customer has authorized the use of the Sub-processors located at legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors.
