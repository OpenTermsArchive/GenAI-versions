(e) _In-Product Cookies._ Whenever Customers or Users interact with the Services, Jasper uses First Party Cookies to collect information to ensure Customers and Users can securely, quickly and reliably use the Services, and Jasper’s In-Product Cookie Policy applies. When Jasper collects this information, it only uses this data to (i) provide the Services, or (ii) in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify the Customers or Users personally.

**6\. Confidentiality**

(a) _Confidentiality._ During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, each Party agrees to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other Party in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of a like kind; provided that a Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with Disclosing Party’s consent or to its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, subcontractors, agents or prospective financing sources or acquirers who need to know such information in connection with this Agreement and who are bound by written agreements requiring the protection of such Confidential Information. This Section 6 shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between Customer and Jasper entered prior to the Effective Date that would purport to address the confidentiality of Confidential Information and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to either Party’s Confidential Information.

(b) _Compelled Disclosure._ If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.

(c) _Return of Confidential Information._ At any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all copies thereof and notes and other materials incorporating such Confidential Information, whether in physical or electronic form; provided, however, (x) Jasper, as Receiving Party, shall not be required to delete any Customer Confidential Information that is licensed to Jasper pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) so long as it is aggregated and de-identified so that it cannot identify Customer or its Users; and (y) the Receiving Party shall not be required to return or destroy electronic copies that are automatically stored in accordance with Receiving Party’s generally applicable backup policies and which are not reasonably accessible by the Receiving Party (“Backup Media”). All Backup Media shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, so long as it remains undeleted.

(d) _Remedies._ If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in breach of this Section 6, the Disclosing Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.

**7\. Warranties; Disclaimers**

(a) _Mutual Warranties_. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement.

(b) _Jasper Warranties._ Jasper warrants to Customer that the Services purchased by Customer will, in all material respects, perform in accordance with the applicable portions of the Documentation. This warranty shall not apply to non-conformities, errors, or problems caused by acts within the control of Customer or any of its Users, or arising from Customer’s negligence or improper use of the Services, from unauthorized modifications made to the Services, from use of the Services in an unsupported operating environment or manner, or that arises from Customer’s or any third party’s software or systems (including Third Party Products).

(c) _Customer Warranties._ Customer warrants that it will not use the Services for unlawful purposes or in a manner that infringes or otherwise violates the rights of any third party.

IN ADDITION, JASPER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF CUSTOMER PROPERTY STORED BY JASPER. CUSTOMER AGREES TO MAINTAIN A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COPY OF ALL CUSTOMER PROPERTY IN A LOCATION INDEPENDENT OF THE SERVICES.

(e) _Beta Services._ Jasper may make Beta Services available to Customer at no charge, and Customer may choose to try such Beta Services in its sole discretion. Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to Customer. Beta Services are not considered “Services” under this Agreement for purposes of Section 7 (Warranties; Disclaimer) and Sections 8(a) (Indemnification by Jasper); however, all restrictions, Jasper’s reservation of rights and Customer’s obligations concerning the Services, and use of any Third Party Products shall apply equally to Customer’s use of Beta Services. Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from the trial start date or the date otherwise specified in writing by Jasper. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available. Beta Services are provided “AS IS'' with no express or implied warranty and are outside the scope of Jasper’s indemnification obligations.

**8\. Indemnification**

(a) _Indemnification by Jasper._ Jasper will defend and pay Customer, its employees, directors and officers (the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all costs, damages and expenses (collectively, “Losses”), suffered or incurred by any Customer Indemnified Party, as a result of any claim brought by a third party (“Third Party Claim”) against a Customer Indemnified Party alleging that the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement infringes any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of such third party (an “Infringement Claim”). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Services is likely to, in Jasper’s sole opinion, or does become the subject of an Infringement Claim, Jasper may, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item, (ii) substitute a functionally equivalent non-infringing replacement for such item, or (iii) modify such item to make it non-infringing and functionally equivalent, or (iv) terminate the Agreement and refund to Customer prepaid unused fees for the infringing items that Jasper received from Reseller. Jasper shall have no liability for any Infringement Claim to the extent arising from (1) Customer’s use or supply to Jasper of any Customer Property; (2) use of the Services in combination with any software, hardware, network or system not supplied by Jasper if the alleged infringement relates to such combination; (3) any modification or alteration of the Services (other than by Jasper); or (4) the Output, or (5) Customer’s violation of applicable law or third party rights.

(b) _Indemnification by Customer._ Customer will defend and pay Jasper, its employees, directors and officers (the “Jasper Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Losses, suffered or incurred by any Jasper Indemnified Party, arising from any Third Party Claim against a Jasper Indemnified Party (i) alleging that any Customer Property or Customer’s use of the Services beyond the license granted in this Agreement infringes, violates or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark, publicity, trade secret or other intellectual property right of any third party or (ii) arising from Customer’s breach of the Platform Guidelines.

(c) _Indemnification Conditions._ The Parties’ obligations under this Section 8 are contingent upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section 8, (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim that adversely affects the rights or interests of the indemnified party without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section 8 are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies available to the indemnified party in the event of an applicable Third Party Claim.

NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INCONVENIENCE SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR BY ANY THIRD PERSON, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSS, DAMAGE OR INCONVENIENCE IS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE OTHER PARTY TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATION APPLIES EVEN IF A PARTY’S REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

(c) _Exceptions_.

The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures.

The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment.

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from the other Party in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business.

(l) _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.
