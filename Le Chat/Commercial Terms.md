Partner Served - Deployment Terms

_Effective 27 May 2025_

Preamble
--------

These deployment terms (these “**Terms**”) govern your use of the products and/or Mistral AI Products, including artificial intelligence models (the "**Models**"), provided by Mistral AI (the "**Mistral AI Products**") through: 

* Our cloud provider partners (the "**Cloud Providers**"), on the Cloud Provider's infrastructure (the "P**artner Infrastructure**"), or your infrastructure ("**Your Infrastructure**"), or 
    
* Our resellers (the "**Resellers**") on Your Infrastructure.
    

In these Terms, we refer to the Cloud Provider Infrastructure and Your Infrastructure as the "**Infrastructure**". We refer to Cloud Providers and Resellers as "**Partners**".  The Mistral AI Products are provided by Mistral AI, a French limited corporation, having its registered offices at 15 rue des Halles, 75001 Paris, France.

We encourage you to read and understand these Terms because by accessing or using any of the Mistral AI Products through a Partner, you are agreeing to these Terms which constitute an agreement between you and Mistral AI.

Here are some key points to understand about using the Mistral AI Products via a Partner:

* We do not have access to the Infrastructure or Your Data and do not use Your Data to train our Models.
    
* You also have a contract with the Partner that governs your use of the Partner Infrastructure (if applicable) and any Mistral AI Products provided by such Partner (the “Partner Terms”).
    
* When you use the Mistral AI Products through a Cloud Provider on the Infrastructure, the Cloud Provider is your sole point of contact, including for support.
    

1\. Responsibilities
--------------------

### 1.1 Our responsibilities

We are responsible for providing the Mistral AI Products to you on the Infrastructure in accordance with applicable laws and these Terms.

### 1.2 The Partner’s responsibilities

The Partner is responsible for billing and collecting any fees for use of the Mistral AI Products on the Infrastructure. 

When you use the Mistral AI Products through a Cloud Provider, the Cloud Provider is responsible for (a) making the Mistral AI Products available to you on the Infrastructure, (b) providing you with the Partner Infrastructure (if applicable) and complementary Mistral AI Products, and (c) being your sole point of contact for any requests related to the Mistral AI Products on the Infrastructure.

This right includes the rights to (a) integrate our Mistral AI Product into Your Offerings (as defined in Section 6) and (b) use the Mistral AI Products for your own internal business purposes.

You only receive rights to use the Mistral AI Products as explicitly granted in these Terms. You will not, and will not permit any other person to:

(a) use the Mistral AI Products or Your Data in a manner that violates any applicable laws (including trade laws, and sanctions and export control laws), these Terms, or any of our policies;

(f) use any method to extract any content from the Mistral AI Products other than Outputs; or

(g) distribute or market the Mistral AI Products as a standalone product or Mistral AI Product and/or act as a distributor of the Mistral AI Products without our prior written consent.

When the Mistral AI Products are provided on the Partner Infrastructure, any support requests must be made to the Partner, in accordance with the Partner Terms. 

### 2.4 Mistral AI Product discontinuation

We reserve the right to discontinue the availability of the Mistral AI Products. We will provide a minimum notice period of six (6) months prior to the discontinuation of any Mistral AI Product. During such notice period, the Mistral AI Product will not be available to any new customers. You are responsible for ensuring that your contact information is up-to-date to receive such notifications.

### 2.5 Specific Access

“Specific Access” refers to any Mistral AI Product where you have access to the weights of our Mistral AI Products. If your subscription includes Specific Access, the following terms apply to your use of the Mistral AI Products:

* (a) Our Mistral AI Products and their weights are highly confidential and you must ensure their confidentiality by implementing confidentiality and security measures at least as stringent as those you use to protect your own Confidential Information (as defined in Section 9) of similar sensitivity;
    
* (b) In the event of any unauthorized disclosure or access to our Mistral AI Products or their weights (each, a “Security Incident”), you must immediately notify us at legal@mistral.ai. Such notification must include at least the following details: (a) the time the Security Incident occurred, (b) the Model affected by the Security Incident, (c) the nature and impact of the Security Incident, and (d) the measures which have been taken or which are proposed to be taken to address the Security Incident and to mitigate its possible adverse effects.
    
* (c) You acknowledge that we implement security measures, such as watermarking, for each Model provided to users whose subscriptions include Specific Access to ensure the Model’s traceability. While these measures allow us to trace our Mistral AI Products, they do not allow us to access or use that specific copy of the Model or Your Data.
    

3\. Your User Data
------------------

### 3.1 Your Data

You and your authorized users may provide input to the Mistral AI Products (“Input”), and receive output from the Mistral AI Products based on the Input (“Output”).

If you deactivate these filters, you are solely responsible for the Output that is generated.

### 3.3 Similarity of Output

Due to the nature of the Mistral AI Products, your Output may be similar or identical to the response generated for another user of the Mistral AI Products. We provide no guarantees that your Output will be unique.

Subject to the Partner Terms, either party may terminate this Agreement upon providing written notice to the other party if the other party commits a material breach of any term or condition of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice specifying the breach.

### 7.4 Other causes of termination

These Terms will automatically terminate upon the termination or expiration of (i) our agreement with Partner that enables you to access the Mistral AI Products on the Infrastructure or (ii) your agreement with Partner that enables you to access the Mistral AI Product on the Infrastructure.

### 7.5 Effects of termination

Termination or expiration will not affect any rights or obligations, including the payment of amounts due, which have accrued under these Terms up to the date of termination or expiration. Upon termination or expiration of these Terms, the provisions that are intended by their nature to survive termination will survive and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, including confidentiality obligations, limitations of liability, and disclaimers.

Upon any expiration or termination of these Terms, you will (a) cease to use the Mistral AI Products (including all Customized Mistral AI Products); and (b) destroy and certify the destruction within seven (7) days of the effective date of termination or expiration of these Terms: (i) all copies of the Mistral AI Products (including all Customized Mistral AI Products) you may have in your possession on Your Infrastructure and (ii) all copies of Mistral AI Confidential Information you may have in your possession on Your Infrastructure. “Customized Mistral AI Product” means a Mistral AI Product that has been customized under these Terms, including by means of combining the Mistral AI Product and Customer Owned Developments.

8\. Personal Data
-----------------

We may process your personal data included in your support requests. If you use the Mistral AI Products through a Partner, we may act as your Processor for the processing of personal data included in your support request and such processing shall be governed by our [Data Processing Agreement,](https://mistral.ai/terms/#data-processing-agreement) unless otherwise stated in the Partner Terms. 

9\. Confidentiality
-------------------

Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any and all information, in any medium, which is provided by one Party (“Discloser”) to the other Party (“Recipient”), that is either (a) marked as “confidential”, “proprietary” or similar words, or if disclosed orally, confirmed in writing as such by the Discloser following the disclosure; or (b) any information which Recipient should have reasonably considered to be confidential under the circumstances surrounding disclosure. 

Confidentiality obligation. Each Party acknowledges that during the course of performing its obligations hereunder it may receive or disclose Confidential Information. Each Party expressly acknowledges that the Confidential Information of the other Party may consist of trade secrets and proprietary information having significant commercial value, and that knowledge of all or any part of the Confidential Information would potentially yield a competitive advantage over others not having such knowledge. Accordingly, neither Party will (a) use the Confidential Information of the other Party except to exercise rights or perform obligations under this Agreement or (b) disclose the Confidential Information of the other Party to any third party except to Recipient’s directors, employees, or consultants to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, provided that all such recipients are obligated by a written agreement containing confidentiality obligations at least as stringent as described herein. Each Party will take such steps as may be reasonable in the circumstances, or as may be reasonably requested by the other party, to prevent any unauthorized disclosure, copying or use of the Confidential Information by such third parties. Each Party may also disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by judicial or governmental order or as necessary to comply with any applicable law or regulation governing regulated businesses or the issuance of securities to the public, provided that the party making the disclosure gives the other party reasonable notice prior to such disclosure and, in the case of a judicial or governmental order, complies with any applicable protective order or equivalent. Recipient agrees to exercise due care in protecting Discloser’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure, and at a minimum will use at least the degree of care a reasonable person would use with respect to Confidential Information of similar sensitivity. Recipient will promptly notify Discloser if Recipient becomes aware of any unauthorized disclosure or access to Discloser’s Confidential Information, or any security incident that may result in any unauthorized disclosure or access to Discloser’s Confidential Information and will cooperate with Discloser to remedy any such unauthorized disclosure or access and/or secure such Confidential Information.

Exclusions. Confidential Information herein will not include information that: (a) Recipient can demonstrate by its written records to have had in its possession prior to disclosure by Discloser; (b) was part of the public knowledge or literature, not as a result of  any action or inaction of Recipient; (c) was subsequently disclosed to Recipient from a  source other than Discloser who was not bound by an obligation of confidentiality to Discloser; or (d) Recipient can demonstrate by its written records to have been independently developed by Recipient without the use, directly or indirectly, of any Confidential  Information.

10\. Audit
----------

This Section 10 (Audit) only applies when you use the Mistral AI Products on Your Infrastructure and through a Reseller.

During the Term and for one (1) year thereafter, Mistral AI may, at its own expense and with thirty (30) business days' notice, conduct audits (up to one (1) audit per year) to ensure your compliance with Sections 2.1 (License) and 7.5 (Effects of Termination). You agree to provide all relevant documents and grant access to your premises and computer systems to enable Mistral AI to assess Customer’s compliance with this Agreement. Audits will be conducted by a third-party company selected by Mistral AI, free from any competitive interests with you and bound by professional confidentiality. You agree to cooperate in good faith with the appointed third-party auditor, providing necessary information and responding to audit-related inquiries. Audits must not unduly disrupt your business operations. If the audit reveals unauthorized use of the Mistral AI Products or Confidential Information, Mistral AI may: (a) instruct Reseller to charge you additional fees that you should have paid due to such unauthorized use; or (b) mandate the destruction of unauthorized versions or copies of the Mistral AI Products and/or Confidential Information. In the event of audit findings indicating Customer’s breach of the Agreement, the costs of the audit will be borne by Customer only. 

11.  General Provisions
-----------------------

Assignment. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms and any attempt to do so will be void. We may assign our rights or obligations under these Terms to any affiliate, subsidiary, or successor in interest of any business associated with our Mistral AI Product.

Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms (except for a failure to pay fees) if such delay or failure is due to unforeseen events beyond the reasonable control of such party.

Independent Contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created between the parties under these Terms. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

No Third-Party Rights. There are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.

Waivers. No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or of any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Entire Agreement; severability. Unless otherwise agreed in writing between you and Mistral AI, these Terms, constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the Mistral AI Products. Any statements or comments made between you and any of our employees or representatives are expressly excluded from these Terms and will not apply to you or us, or to your access to or use of the Mistral AI products. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect.

Governing law and venue. (a) Unless you are located in the United States, the laws of France will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any applicable Additional Terms), or related Mistral AI Products, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the courts located in Paris, France, and you and Mistral AI consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. (b) If you are located in the United States, California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any applicable Additional Terms), or related Mistral AI Products, regardless of conflict of laws rules.
