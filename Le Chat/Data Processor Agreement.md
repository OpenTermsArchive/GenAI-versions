A description of the Processing is available in the Description of Processing. Mistral AI may update the Description of the Processing from time to time to reflect new Mistral AI Products, features, functionalities or Subprocessors.

### 2.3 Mistral AI as Controller

Mistral AI is authorized to process the Personal Data as Controller for the purposes of:

* Training its artificial intelligence models in accordance with its [Privacy Policy](https://mistral.ai/terms#privacy-policy), unless (a) Customer opted-out of training or (b) uses a Mistral AI Product that is opted-out by default and has not opted-in.

3\. General obligations of the Parties
--------------------------------------

### 3.1 Obligations of Mistral AI

Mistral AI shall:

* Process the Personal Data only in accordance with the documented lawful instructions of Customer, including as set forth in this DPA or the Agreement, , unless required to do so by applicable laws.
