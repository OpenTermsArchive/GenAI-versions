-------------

**Your Data.** You and your authorized users may provide input to the Mistral AI Products, such as prompts or fine-tuning data (“Input”), and receive output from the Mistral AI Products based on such Input (“Output”). We refer to Input and Output collectively as “Your Data”. For clarity, any third-party content displayed on or through the Mistral AI Products to help you understand the Output, such as hyperlinks, snippets or thumbnails, for which you are only granted a right to view and read (the “Third-Party Content”) do not constitute Output. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you (i) retain all ownership rights in Input and (ii) own all Output. We assign to you all right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output that we may have.

**Responsibility for Your Data.** You are responsible for all Input and represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions required to provide Input to the Mistral AI Products. You are solely responsible for all use of the Outputs and evaluating the Output for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case. You must also not represent that the Output was generated by a human when it was generated by the Mistral AI Products. We may also provide Output filters for certain Mistral AI Products. If you deactivate these filters, you are solely responsible for the Output that is generated.

**Output restrictions.**  To the extent permitted by the applicable laws, you may not use: (a) image Outputs to develop or train any competing image-generation Mistral AI Product and (b) Outputs generated using our web-search feature to (i) copy, store, archive, cache or create a database of the Outputs, (ii) redistribute, resell, or sublicense the Outputs, (iii) as part of any machine learning or similar algorithmic activity, or (iv) to create, train, evaluate or improve Your Offerings.

**Similarity of Output.** Due to the nature of the Mistral AI Products, your Output may be similar or identical to the response generated for another user of the Mistral AI Products. We provide no guarantees that your Output will be unique. Any responses generated for other users by the Mistral AI Product are not considered your Output even if similar or identical to your Output.

**Output Accuracy.** Mistral AI Products are based on large language models (LLMs), a technology in continuous evolution. For this reason, the Output may occasionally be inaccurate. Mistral AI Products are not authoritative or infallible sources of information. In any case, you should not rely on the Output generated by Mistral AI Products as the sole source of truth or as a substitute for professional advice (e.g., legal, tax, or medical). It is recommended to use caution when using Mistral AI Products: always verify the reliability, accuracy, and completeness of the Output before relying on it for personal or professional purposes or publishing it.

**Illegal content.** You have the availability to report to us any of Your Data or Third-Party Content that violate our [Usage Policy](https://mistral.ai/terms/#usage-policy) or (a) incites hate, violence, or discrimination against individuals based on their origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc., (b) glorifies sexual harassment, (c) violates human dignity (e.g., human trafficking or pimping), (d) glorifies crimes against humanity or denying their existence, (e) incites terrorism, (f) glorifies very serious crimes against individuals (e.g., murder or sexual assault), (g) glorifies crimes involving theft, extortion, or material damage posing a danger to individuals, (h) constitute child abuse sexual material, or (i) are dangerous for minors.

This right is granted worldwide and for the duration of the intellectual property rights under applicable law. Where applicable, you must delete such content using the applicable feature on the Mistral AI Products.

**Third-Party Content.** When you use certain features on a Mistral AI Product, such as web-search, you may receive (a) your Output, and (b) Third-Party Content in the form of additional resources such as hyperlinks, thumbnails, or snippets from third-parties to help you further explore or understand the Output. Such Third-Party Content does not constitute Your Data and you shall have no right to this Third-Party Content, other than viewing it. For clarity, we do not use the Third-Party Content you provide in Your Input to train our artificial intelligence models.

3\. Legal warranty
------------------

### 3.1 Legal warranty

Along with any commercial warranty provided under these Terms or the applicable Additional Terms, Consumers residing in France also benefit from the following legal warranty:

“Le consommateur a droit à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité en cas d’apparition d’un défaut de conformité durant la période de la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique. Durant ce délai, le consommateur n’est tenu d’établir que l’existence du défaut de conformité et non la date d’apparition de celui-ci. La garantie légale de conformité emporte obligation de fournir toutes les mises à jour nécessaires au maintien de la conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique durant la durée d’enregistrement du compte du consommateur sur la plateforme. La garantie légale de conformité donne au consommateur droit à la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique sans retard injustifié suivant sa demande, sans frais et sans inconvénient majeur pour lui. Le consommateur peut obtenir une réduction du prix en conservant le contenu numérique ou le service numérique, ou il peut mettre fin au contrat en se faisant rembourser intégralement contre renoncement au contenu numérique ou au service  numérique, si :

1. Le professionnel refuse de mettre le contenu numérique ou le service numérique en conformité ;
    
2. La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique est retardée de manière injustifiée ;
    
3. La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique ne peut intervenir sans frais imposés au consommateur ;
    
4. La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service  numérique occasionne un inconvénient majeur pour le consommateur ;
    
5. La non-conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique persiste en dépit de la tentative de mise en conformité du professionnel restée infructueuse.
    

Le consommateur a également droit à une réduction du prix ou à la résolution du contrat lorsque le défaut de conformité est si grave qu’il justifie que la réduction du prix ou la résolution du contrat soit immédiate. Le consommateur n’est alors pas tenu de demander la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique au préalable. Dans les cas où le défaut de conformité est mineur, le consommateur n’a droit à l’annulation du contrat que si le contrat ne prévoit pas le paiement d’un prix. Toute période d’indisponibilité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique en vue de sa remise en conformité suspend la garantie qui restait à courir jusqu’à la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique de nouveau conforme. Ces droits résultent de l’application des articles L. 224-25-1 à L. 224-25-31 du code de la consommation. Le professionnel qui fait obstacle de mauvaise foi à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité encourt une amende civile d’un montant maximal de 300 000 euros, qui peut être porté jusqu’à 10 % du chiffre d’affaires moyen annuel (article L. 242-18-1 du code de la consommation). Le consommateur bénéficie également de la garantie légale des vices cachés en application des articles 1641 à 1649 du code civil, pendant une durée de deux ans à compter de la découverte du défaut. Cette garantie donne droit à une réduction de prix si le contenu numérique ou le service numérique est conservé, ou à un remboursement intégral contre renonciation au contenu numérique ou au service numérique."

4\. Dispute resolution
----------------------

If you are a consumer residing within the European Union, you have the right to start a mediation process in case of a dispute. 

To this end, you may contact our mediation Mistral AI Product, the CMAP, (a) by mail at Centre de Médiation et d’Arbitrage de Paris, 39 avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt, 75008 PARIS or (b) by email at cmap@cmap.fr.

Any dispute which may arise under the Terms of Service or any Additional Terms shall be submitted to the competent court of the place of your residence or domicile.

With this option, your Input and Output are processed only as long as necessary to generate the Output and are not retained further, except as required by law. To activate zero data retention, you must submit your request via our Help Center (available on your account) or support@mistral.ai. As part of this request, you must provide sufficient detail of your legitimate reasons for requesting zero data retention. We will review your request and, at our discretion, approve or deny the request.

**The Fine-Tuning API.** Our fine-tuning API allows you to fine-tune our models on La Plateforme using Your Data (the “**Fine-Tuning API**”). Upon completion of a fine-tuning job, you can use the fine-tuned model (the “**Fine-Tuned Model**”) on La Plateforme. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fine-Tuned Model does not constitute an Output. You are solely responsible for the fine-tuning process and the Input you used to fine-tune our models. We are not responsible for the performance of the Fine-Tuned Model or its Outputs. Your rights to access or use the Fine-Tuned Model will cease upon termination of your account. You can delete the Fine-Tuned Model from La Plateforme at any time. We will not use the Fine-Tuned Model except to provide it to you under these Terms. We will not disclose or distribute the Fine-Tuned Model to third parties without your consent, except for authorized transfers to our cloud-provider distributors.

**Agent creation and management.** You can create an agent either through our Fine-Tuning API or through the agent builder feature on La Plateforme by following the instructions given on La Plateforme. Your rights to access or use your agent will cease after the termination of your account. You can share your agent with your authorized users in your workspace via our API or Le Chat, subject to your subscription plan. Any use of your agent on Le Chat is governed by the Additional Terms for Le Chat. By default, agents are shared with all of the authorized users in your workspace. You must set specific permissions to restrict access to your agents to specific authorized users. We will not use your agent except to provide it to you under these Terms. We will not disclose or distribute your agent to third parties without your consent. You are responsible for the creation and performance of your agent. Specifically, you must ensure that the name of your agent complies with applicable laws and the rights of third parties. You can delete your agent from La Plateforme at any time.

As such, it is your responsibility to ensure that there is no information you are not comfortable sharing before sharing the Conversation Link, including personal information, confidential information, sensitive business information, or trade secrets.

**Library.** You may add and manage content such as documents or websites to your library on Le Chat (“**Your Library**”). You are solely responsible for any content you add to your Library and for managing access to your Library within your workspace. This includes ensuring you have or hold the necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to add such content to Your Library and use such Content on Le Chat. 

**Connecting Third-Party Services to Le Chat.** You may connect authorized Third-Party Services to Le Chat. By doing so, you grant us permission to access, retrieve, process and store content from these Third-Party Services to provide the Mistral AI Products to you.

As a result, your authorized users will only have access to content for which they have been granted permissions on the Third-Party Service. You bear full responsibility for configuring and managing ACLs within the Third-Party Services environment.
