These Data Security Terms apply when they are expressly incorporated by reference into terms for Meta Products (any such terms, "**Applicable Product Terms**"), such as the [Meta Business Tools Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools), or the [Customer List Custom Audience Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/customaudience). Terms used but not defined in these Data Security Terms have the meanings given in the applicable product terms. These Data Security Terms describe the minimum security standards that Meta maintains applicable to the Meta Products made available under the applicable product terms ("**applicable products**"), including the data you send to Meta using the applicable products ("**covered data**").

* **Organisation of information security.** Meta has personnel responsible for oversight of security of the applicable products.
  
* **Physical and environmental security.** Meta's security measures will include controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that physical access to Meta data centres is limited to authorised persons and that environmental controls are established to detect, prevent and control destruction due to environmental hazards. The controls will include:

        * verifying the identity of the personnel with access to covered data; and
        * performing background checks, where legally permissible, on personnel working on or supporting aspects pertaining to the applicable products in accordance with Meta standards.
        
    * Personnel security breach. Meta will take disciplinary action in the event of unauthorised access to covered data by Meta personnel, including, where legally permissible, punishments up to and including termination.
    
  
* **Security testing.** Meta will perform regular security and vulnerability testing to assess whether key controls are implemented properly and are effective.
  
* **Access control.**
    
    * Password management. Meta has established and will maintain procedures for password management for its personnel, designed to ensure that passwords are personal to each individual, and inaccessible to unauthorised persons, including at minimum:
        
        * password provisioning, including procedures designed to verify the identity of the user prior to a new, replacement or temporary password;
        * cryptographically protecting passwords when stored in computer systems or in transit over the network;
        * altering default passwords from vendors;
        * strong passwords relative to their intended use; and
        * education on good password practices.
        
      
    * Access management. Meta will also control and monitor its personnel's access to its systems using the following:
        
        * established procedures for changing and revoking access rights and user IDs, without undue delay;
        * established procedures for reporting and revoking compromised access credentials (passwords, tokens etc.);
        * maintaining appropriate security logs including where applicable with user ID and timestamp;
        * synchronising clocks with NTP; and

            * Authorisation changes;
            * Failed and successful authentication and access attempts; and
            * Read and write operations.
            
        
    
  
* **Communications security**
    
    * Network security
        
        * Meta will employ technology that is consistent with industry standards for network segregation.
        * Remote network access to Meta systems will require encrypted communication via secured protocols and use of multi-factor authentication.
        
    * Protection of data in transit
        
        * Meta will enforce use of appropriate protocols designed to protect the confidentiality of data in transit over public networks.
        
    
  
* **Vulnerability management.** Meta has instituted and will maintain a vulnerability management programme covering the applicable products that includes definitions of roles and responsibilities for vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment and patch deployment.
  
* **Security incident management**
    
    * Security incident response. Meta will maintain a security incident response plan for monitoring, detecting and handling possible security incidents affecting covered data. The security incident response plan at least includes definitions of roles and responsibility, communication, and post-mortem reviews, including root cause analysis and remediation plans.
    * Monitoring. Meta will monitor for any security breaches and malicious activity affecting covered data.
    

In the event of any express conflict between the applicable product terms and these Data Security Terms, the applicable product terms will govern solely with respect to your use of the applicable products and solely to the extent of the conflict. Meta may update these Data Security Terms from time to time to reflect evolving security standards.

These measures shall be appropriate to the level of risk presented by the Processing (and having regard to the nature of Company EU Data which is to be protected) and to the harm which might result from a Personal Data Breach affecting Company EU Data.
  
* Taking into account the nature of the Processing, provide assistance reasonably requested by Company by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, in order to allow Company to comply with its obligations to Data Subjects who exercise their rights under Chapter III of the GDPR.
  
* Taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Meta EU Processor, provide assistance as reasonably requested by Company in order to allow Company to comply with its obligations under Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR.
  
* Make available to Company, on Company's reasonable request, all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations under Article 28 of the GDPR.
  
* Where Meta EU Processor deems appropriate, procure that a third-party auditor conducts a SOC 2 Type II or other industry standard audit of Meta EU Processor's controls relating to Company EU Data. Company mandates Meta Ireland to procure this audit on its behalf in order to audit Meta EU Processor's compliance with its obligations under the GDPR as a Processor. At Company's request annually, Meta EU Processor shall provide Company with a copy of its then-current audit report and such report shall be deemed Meta EU Processor's confidential information.

3.3 Company agrees that Meta UK Processor may subcontract the Processing of Company UK Data to Meta Affiliates (including Meta Ireland), in which case, such Meta Affiliates agree to comply with Section 3.2 in respect of its Processing of Company UK Data as a Sub-processor.

* International Data Transfers.

4.1 The Parties acknowledge that, to the extent that Company transfers Company EU Data to Meta Ireland, the SCCs (or any other safeguards under Article 46 of the GDPR) are not required on the basis that Meta Ireland is located in the EU.
