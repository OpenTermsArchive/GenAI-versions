_Effective Date:_ _**November 6, 2025**_

**Introduction**
----------------

These terms constitute a legal agreement between you and **Lovable Labs Incorporated** (“**Lovable**,” “**we**,” or “**us**”). Your use of **lovable.dev** (the “**Site**”) and the services made available on the Site (the “**Services**”) is subject to these Terms of Service (these “**Terms**”). By using the Site and any of our Services, you:

* Acknowledge that you have read and understood these Terms;
* Agree to be bound by these Terms;
* Agree to our [Privacy Policy](https://lovable.dev/privacy); and
* Commit to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms.

We may revise these Terms at any time by posting updated terms on the Site or providing you with notice. Your continued use of the Services after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

**Definitions**
===============

When we use the following terms in these Terms, here’s what we mean:

* **“AI Gateway”** means our optional managed API service that lets you access third-party artificial intelligence models (for example, OpenAI, Google, or OpenRouter) through our infrastructure.
* **“Credits”** means the prepaid, non-refundable, non-redeemable units you purchase or receive to use the Services. Credits are consumed as you use the Platform, Lovable Cloud, the AI Gateway, or other usage-based features.
* **“Customer Data”** means any content, code, text, images, files, or other data that you input, upload, submit, host, or generate through the Services, including applications you create using the Platform. Customer Data does not include Usage Data or Lovable Materials.

**License to Use Our Services**
===============================

Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Services for your personal or internal business purposes, as permitted by your subscription plan. This license does not give you any ownership interest in the Services or Lovable Materials, and all rights not expressly granted are reserved by us. This license terminates immediately if you violate these Terms or your account is terminated for any reason.

Subdomain Usage and Management
------------------------------

If you use our Services to deploy applications or websites on subdomains under lovable.app (for example, \[your-site-name\].lovable.app), you acknowledge and agree that:

* Lovable retains all ownership rights in the lovable.app domain and all subdomains.
* We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to reclaim, reassign, redirect, suspend, or terminate any subdomain at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to:
    * enabling the subdomain to be used by another user or for another purpose that better serves the Lovable community;
    * preventing confusion, impersonation, or trademark infringement;
    * addressing abuse, policy violations, inappropriate content, or violations of our [Platform Rules](https://lovable.dev/platform-rules);
    * recycling inactive or underutilized subdomain names, particularly common word or single word subdomains;
    * technical, operational, or business reasons.
* We will generally provide a **7 days advance notice** before reclaiming a subdomain to allow you time to transition to a custom domain or challenge the reclamation. However, we reserve the right to reclaim subdomains immediately without notice when necessary to address urgent issues, including but not limited to violations of our [Platform Rules](https://lovable.dev/platform-rules), legal requirements, security threats, or abuse.
* You have no proprietary, possessory, or ongoing rights to any specific subdomain, and reclamation of a subdomain does not entitle you to a refund or any other compensation.
* You should not rely on the permanent availability of any particular subdomain and should use custom domains for mission-critical applications.
* All content hosted on lovable.app subdomains must comply with our [Platform Rules](https://lovable.dev/platform-rules).

Suspension and Termination for Breach
=====================================

We may suspend or terminate your account, access to the Services, or any portion of them immediately if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms (including the License Restrictions above) or engaged in fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful activity. Suspension or termination does not limit any other remedies available to us under law or equity, and you remain responsible for all fees and charges incurred up to the date of suspension or termination.

**Billing & Payments**
======================

Platform Subscriptions

You can use the Platform under a free or paid plan, as described on the Site. Paid plans are billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis and renew automatically unless you cancel before the renewal date in your account settings. Plan limits (for example, seats, features, or usage thresholds) are described on the Site and may change from time to time. Except where required by law, subscription fees are non-refundable.

Credits and Separate Balances (Optional Services)

Company Cloud and the AI Gateway run on Credits. You have two separate balances—one for Company Cloud and one for the AI Gateway. Credits are consumed as you use those Services and are in addition to any Platform subscription fees.

**Free vs. Paid Credits**

* Free Credits: We may grant Free Credits (for example, $25/month for Company Cloud and $1/month for the AI Gateway). Free Credits expire at the end of each monthly billing cycle and don’t roll over.
* Paid Credits: You can buy Paid Credits anytime. Paid Credits expire 12 months from purchase unless used earlier. Credits don’t earn interest and have no cash or stored-value equivalent.

Buying Credits and Auto-Reload

You may purchase Credits through Stripe or another third-party payment processor that we designate from time to time. By purchasing Credits, you agree to be bound by the applicable terms and conditions of the payment processor in addition to these Terms. You may also enable auto-reload so that your balance is automatically replenished when it falls below a threshold you select. We rely solely on the records, calculations, and determinations of our designated payment processor with respect to payments, metering, invoicing, and account balances, and you agree that those determinations are final and binding absent manifest error.

Invoices and Records

We issue monthly invoices that show: (a) your Platform subscription charges (if any), and (b) your usage by Service (Company Cloud vs. AI Gateway). Invoices are generated based on the records of our designated third-party payment processor (such as Stripe). We rely solely on the records, calculations, and determinations of that payment processor with respect to payments, metering, invoicing, and account balances, and you agree that those determinations are final and binding absent manifest error.

No Refunds; Not a Financial Instrument

Credits are prepaid, non-refundable, and non-redeemable for cash or any other value. Credits represent only a limited license to access the Services and are not deposits, stored value, or financial instruments. For expiration and forfeiture rules, see the “**Refunds and Termination”** section.

Metering and Third-Party Dependencies

We use reasonable efforts to meter usage accurately, but metering depends on third-party services (including Stripe, Supabase, and Third-Party AI Providers). By using the Services, you agree that our metering and billing records are authoritative.

### Taxes and Withholding

Fees and Credits are exclusive of taxes. You’re responsible for any taxes, duties, or government charges that apply, other than taxes based on our income.

**Service Dependencies and Availability**
=========================================

We provide the Services, including the Platform, Lovable Cloud, and the AI Gateway, using a combination of our own technology and third-party providers. These include Infrastructure Providers for Lovable Cloud and Third-Party AI Providers (such as OpenAI, Google, and OpenRouter) for the AI Gateway. Because we do not fully control these providers, we cannot guarantee the uninterrupted availability, performance, or security of the Services. You understand and agree that interruptions, delays, or errors may occur, and that we will not be responsible for issues caused by those providers or by events beyond our reasonable control (including force majeure events).

**AI Use Disclaimer**
=====================

The Services may use artificial intelligence models to generate code, content, or other outputs (“AI Output”). AI Output may contain errors, inaccuracies, or other issues and should not be relied upon without independent review and testing. You are solely responsible for reviewing, validating, and using any AI Output, whether it is generated through:

* our Platform’s integrated AI;
* the AI Gateway (via Third-Party AI Providers such as OpenAI, Google, or OpenRouter); or
* any model or API that you connect to the Services.

You assume full responsibility for your use of AI Output and agree not to rely on it for critical or high-risk functions (including medical, legal, financial, or safety-related purposes) without appropriate safeguards. AI Output may be similar or identical to content generated for other users who submit similar prompts. We do not guarantee that AI Output will be unique, free of third-party rights, accurate, or suitable for any particular purpose.

**Customer Data and Privacy**
=============================

### No Sensitive Data

You agree not to upload, input, or otherwise provide any protected health information under HIPAA, or any other sensitive categories of data (such as financial account numbers, government identifiers, or biometric data). Our Services are not designed to handle that type of data, and we disclaim all responsibility if you choose to submit it.

### Use of Infrastructure and AI Providers

The Services, including the Platform, Lovable Cloud, and the AI Gateway, run in part on Infrastructure Providers (for example, Supabase and other hosting or database providers). In addition, the Platform and the AI Gateway both transmit your inputs, prompts, and related data to artificial intelligence systems, including large language models and other machine learning models, in order to generate code, content, or other outputs. These systems may be provided by us, by Third-Party AI Providers (such as OpenAI, Google, or OpenRouter), or by models that you connect yourself. By using the Services, you consent to these transfers, processing, and storage.

### Rights in Customer Data

Except for PII, you grant us a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, process, analyze, and otherwise exploit your Customer Data for our business purposes, including without limitation:

* operating, maintaining, and improving the Services;
* developing and training artificial intelligence and machine learning models;
* creating benchmarks, analytics, and insights; and
* any other lawful business purpose.

If you do not want your Customer Data used for model training or other business purposes, you may opt out by contacting us or by upgrading to a Business plan that provides enhanced data-handling controls.

### Use of PII

We will not use raw or identifiable PII for model training. We do not sell PII and we do not share it with third parties for advertising or marketing. However, we may anonymize and aggregate PII, and once anonymized and aggregated, we may use it for any business purpose without restriction.

### Retention and Deletion

* We may retain indefinitely Customer Data in an anonymized and aggregated form for the purposes set out in the “Rights in Customer Data” section.
* We can retain PII as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Services.
* We may also retain specific PII, after account closure or deletion requests, for fraud prevention, legal defense, or to comply with our legal obligations.
* Deleted data may persist in backups for a limited time before being permanently removed.
* Usage Data and anonymized or aggregated information may be retained indefinitely.

### Infrastructure Provider Use of Data

Certain Infrastructure Providers may have the right under their own terms to use aggregated or anonymized usage data derived from your activity for their own business purposes. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree to those providers’ rights.

### Customer Responsibility

You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services, including transfers of Customer Data through the Platform, Lovable Cloud, the AI Gateway, or any model or service you connect, complies with applicable data protection and privacy laws.

**Refunds and Termination**
===========================

### Credit Expiration

* Free Credits expire at the end of the monthly billing cycle and do not roll over.
* Paid Credits expire twelve (12) months after purchase unless used earlier.

Forfeiture on Termination

If your account/Services are terminated by us for a breach of the Terms by you, any remaining Credits (Free or Paid) will be forfeited. If you cancel your account/Services, the remaining Credits will remain available until the end of billing period. If we terminate your account/Services for any reason other than your breach of the Terms (including for security, legal, or other reasons not attributable to you), any remaining Credits will be applied to fees owed through the effective date of termination, after which they will expire.

No Refunds

Except where required by law, all fees are non-refundable.

Effect of Termination

Termination of your account or these Terms ends your right to access the Services, but does not affect any rights or obligations that, by their nature, should continue (for example, intellectual property rights, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, and payment obligations).

**Marketing and Promotions**
============================

### Promotional Credits and Offers

From time to time, we may provide you with promotional credits or other promotional offers, such as free access to the AI Gateway for a limited period. Promotional credits and offers are provided at our sole discretion and may be modified or discontinued at any time.

### Restrictions

Promotional credits and offers:

* are non-transferable, non-refundable, and non-redeemable for cash or any other value;
* may be limited to specific Services (for example, only the AI Gateway);
* expire as stated in the promotion, or if no expiration is stated, at the end of the then-current billing cycle; and
* may not be combined with other promotions unless we expressly permit it.

### Revocation

We may revoke, cancel, or adjust promotional credits or offers at any time if we reasonably believe they were obtained fraudulently, used in violation of these Terms, or provided in error.

Affiliate Program Terms
=======================

By participating in Lovable's affiliate program, you agree to the following terms:

No Self-Referrals

Affiliates may not refer themselves. Self-referrals will be automatically blocked and may result in account termination.

No Brand Bidding

Affiliates may not bid on "Lovable" or any misspellings or variations of the brand in paid search ads (e.g., Google Ads). Violations will result in forfeiture of all commissions in the month where a violation occurred, permanent exclusion from affiliate commissions for any users acquired through brand bidding (as these users would have found Lovable organically), and possible account deactivation.

No Search Engine Traffic

Affiliates are also generally not permitted to generate commissions by driving traffic to their link via search engine ads.

No Spam or Misleading Promotions

Affiliates may not use spammy tactics, misleading claims, or false endorsements in promoting Lovable. This includes fake discounts, deceptive landing pages, or unauthorized use of brand assets.

Payouts Are Conditional

Rewards are only granted for valid, completed signups that meet the criteria set in the campaign.  
Fraudulent or incomplete referrals will not be paid out.

Termination Rights

Lovable reserves the right to revoke affiliate access and withhold commissions for any violation  
of these Terms or behavior that appears fraudulent, abusive, or misaligned with Lovable's values.

**Term and Termination**
========================

These Terms begin when you first accept them or start using the Services and continue until terminated.

You may terminate your account and stop using the Services at any time through your account settings.

We may terminate your account or access to the Services for convenience by providing you with advance notice, or as otherwise provided in the “**Suspension and Termination for Breach”** section. We may also discontinue or modify the Services in whole or in part at any time by providing you with advance notice.

Upon termination, your right to access the Services ends immediately. You remain responsible for all fees and charges incurred up to the date of termination. Any unused Credits are forfeited as described in the **“Refunds and Termination”** section.

**Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**
========================================

These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to them, the Services, or your use of the Services will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

You agree that the state and federal courts located in Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.

Any dispute with us must be brought on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. You and Lovable each waive any right to a jury trial in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

**Survival**
============

The provisions of these Terms relating to intellectual property, data rights, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, governing law, and any other terms that by their nature should survive, will continue in effect after termination of your account or these Terms.

====================

If you are a business entity, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use your name, logo, and trademarks (“Marks”) to identify you as a customer on our website, in customer lists, pitch materials, investor presentations, and other marketing and promotional materials.

You may revoke this license at any time by giving us written notice. After we receive your notice, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to stop using your Marks in new materials, but we are not required to recall or destroy materials already in use.

You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to grant this license and that our use of your Marks as permitted here will not infringe or misappropriate any third-party rights.
