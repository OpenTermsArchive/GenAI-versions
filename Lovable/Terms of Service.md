Your use of **lovable.dev** (the “**Site**”) and the services made available on the Site (the “**Services**”) is subject to these Terms of Service (these “**Terms**”). By using the Site and any of our Services, you:

We may revise these Terms at any time by posting updated terms on the Site or providing you with notice. Your continued use of the Services after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

License to use our services
---------------------------

Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use our Services. This license includes the right to use the Services for both personal and commercial purposes, subject to your subscription plan and these Terms. This license terminates immediately if you violate these Terms or your account is terminated for any reason.

Intellectual-property rights
----------------------------

### Our rights

Lovable Labs Incorporated (“Lovable”) or its licensors, retain all right, title, and interest in and to all intellectual property and proprietary rights related to its Services, platform, technology, and brand. This includes, without limitation, all copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, patents, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights in and to:

* The Lovable platform, all underlying technology, software, tools, algorithms, templates, AI models, libraries, documentation, infrastructure, and configuration interfaces used to provide or operate the platform, website, and any related sites, domains, or subdomains;
* All software, code (source and object), algorithms, models, features, functionalities, and systems developed by or for Lovable;
* All user interfaces, user experience designs, architecture, layouts, and visual elements;
* All content made available by Lovable, including text, graphics, media, documentation, blogs, marketing materials, and other materials;
* All data generated through the use of the platform, including Usage Data and analytical insights, subject to applicable privacy laws; and
* all improvements, enhancements, modifications, and derivative works of the foregoing, (collectively, “Lovable Materials”).

All such intellectual property and proprietary materials, whether registered or unregistered, are owned by Lovable or its licensors and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws in the United States and internationally.

Except as expressly authorized in writing by Lovable, no rights or licenses are granted to any user or third party, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Lovable.

### Clear distinction of rights

As between the parties, subject to any third party rights and excluding any Lovable Materials, Customer will own all right, title, and interest in the following:

* Customer Data;
* User-generated content; and
* Applications built with our Services.

Data usage, training, and learning
----------------------------------

We collect and process data from your use of the Services to provide the Services, improve our platform, provide support, enhance user experience and, in certain cases, for our general business purposes. The Privacy Policy contains detailed information; this section summarizes how we use data within the Services and clarifies ownership and handling of different types of data.

### Data Categories and Ownership

We categorize data you interact with through the Services into three types:

#### 1\. Usage Data (Owned by Lovable)

Definition:

“Usage Data” refers to telemetry, logs, and technical metadata generated by your use of the Services. This includes:

* Feature usage statistics
* API request and performance metrics
* Device, browser, and operating system metadata
* Session activity and error logs

Ownership and Use:

Lovable owns all Usage Data and may use it without restriction for any business purpose, including to, without limitation:

* Monitor service performance and stability
* Diagnose issues and maintain reliability
* Improve system functionality
* Analyze user trends
* Generate anonymous benchmarks and analytics

Usage Data never includes source code, user-submitted content, or identifiable PII.

#### 2\. Customer Data (Owned by You)

Definition:  
“Customer Data” refers to all content you upload, input, or generate through use of the Services, including:

* Prompts submitted to the platform;
* Generated code and outputs (subject to any third-party rights and excluding Lovable Materials);
* Uploaded files, documents, or code; and
* Project structures, logic, and configurations

Use:  
Lovable may collect, use, store, and process Customer Data solely to provide and improve the Services, including for system operations, support, diagnostics, and security purposes. In addition, Lovable may use Customer Data, excluding any Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) therein, for the purposes of:

* Training and tuning machine learning and AI models;
* Benchmarking and analytics; and
* Developing, improving, and enhancing the functionality and performance of the Services and related technologies; **except where a user is enrolled in an Enterprise Plan or has opted out under a**n Enterprise (**Business Plan**)**.**

For the avoidance of doubt, Lovable will not use PII contained within Customer Data for such training, benchmarking, or product development purposes.

### Operational Access and Benchmarking

To troubleshoot and improve the platform, authorized Lovable personnel may access your workspace data (including prompts, generated code, and logs).

* Access is limited to personnel with a business need; and
* All access is logged and audited

Lovable may generate aggregate, de-identified benchmarks (e.g., error rates, latency, usage statistics). These benchmarks:

* Never include readable source code or project names;
* Are retained even after account or project deletion; and
* May be used for internal metrics, product development, or public-facing performance summaries

If you believe a benchmark identifies you, contact us and we will remove or further anonymize it.

### Enterprise Plan Customers

Enterprise accounts benefit from enhanced controls, including:

* Explicit waiver of AI model training rights; and
* Custom data-handling agreements.  
    Enterprise Plans include all features of the Enterprise (Business Plan) and additional benefits such as custom data handling agreements and dedicated account support, and are available only through direct sales engagement.

### Business Plan Customers

Lovable offers Business Plan tier designed to provide enhanced privacy controls but allowing self-serve purchase. The Business Plan is distinct from Enterprise subscriptions, which are only available through a direct sales engagement.  
The following terms apply specifically to Enterprise (Business Plan) Customers:

* Self-Serve Availability  
    The Business Plan is available for purchase through Lovable’s online checkout and does not require a sales contract or custom negotiation.
    
* Opt-Out of Model Training  
    Business Plan users may opt out of having their Customer Data used for AI model training.
    
* Opt-out must be enabled through account settings, if available, or requested by email to [privacy@lovable.dev](mailto:privacy@lovable.dev).
    
* Upon confirmation, Lovable will exclude the user’s Customer Data from future training datasets.
    
* Retroactive Deletion of Customer Data  
    Business Plan users may request that previously collected Customer Data be deleted from Lovable systems, including removal from training datasets to the extent technically feasible.
    
* This does not apply to de-identified or derived data that no longer contains Customer Data in a form traceable to the user.
    
* No Custom Data Handling Agreements  
    Business Plan users are not eligible for negotiated data handling terms. All data is processed in accordance with Lovable’s standard Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
    
* Precedence over General Terms  
    In case of any conflict between this section and other provisions of the Terms, this section will control for Business Plan users.
    

#### 3\. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Definition:

“Personally Identifiable Information” or PII means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, or could reasonably be linked to a specific individual. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Names
* Email addresses
* IP addresses
* Account identifiers
* Device or location-based data

Use and Handling:

Lovable will only use PII for the following purposes:

* To provide and support the Services, including account management, authentication, support, and billing; and
* For any business purpose, but only in aggregated and de-identified form that does not reasonably identify you or any other individual.

Examples of business purposes include, but are not limited to:

* Product improvement and feature development;
* AI model training and system optimization;
* Analytics and usage insights;
* Reliability and performance benchmarking; and
* Support content enhancement

Lovable does not use raw or identifiable PII for AI training. We do not sell PII and do not share it with third parties for advertising or marketing.  
You may request access to or deletion of your PII at any time by contacting [privacy@lovable.dev](mailto:privacy@lovable.dev).

### Data Retention and Deletion

* Customer Data and PII are retained only as long as necessary for the above purposes or comply with legal obligations.
* Deleted project data is removed from active systems within 30 days and from backups within 90 days.
* Usage Data and de-identified benchmarks may be retained indefinitely.  
    You may request deletion of your data, subject to our legal obligations or technical feasibility.

For Enterprise Plan users or Enterprise (Business Plan) users, Lovable will delete Customer Data from its systems and AI model training datasets upon request. However, in each case, deletion may not extend to derived or de-identified data that is no longer associated with a specific user or account. No deletion requests will override legal obligations to retain certain data (e.g., for fraud prevention or tax compliance).

### Our commitment to responsible data usage

We utilize industry standard data-access controls, conduct regular security audits, and practice transparent data usage.
