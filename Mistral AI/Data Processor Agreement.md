2\. Role of the Parties
-----------------------

**Mistral AI as Data Processor.** With respect to the Processing described in Exhibit 1, the Customer shall act as the Data Controller and Mistral AI shall act as the Data Processor.

**Description of the Processing.** Mistral AI processes the Personal Data on behalf of the Customer in order to provide the Customer with the Services it ordered under the Agreement. A description of the Processing is available in Exhibit 1 of this DPA. The Customer agrees that Mistral AI may update the description of the Processing from time to time to reflect new Services, features or functionalities. Mistral AI will notify the Customer of any update to the description of the Processing by email no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of the modification. The Customer may object to this modification or update during the notice period on reasonable grounds pertaining to the Applicable Data Protection Law. The Parties will consult and negotiate in good faith in a view of achieving a satisfactory resolution. Failing that, the Customer will be entitled to terminate the Agreement for convenience.

**Mistral AI as Data Controller.** The Customer authorizes Mistral AI to process the Prompts and the Outputs as Data Controller for the purpose of (a) monitoring abuse, (b) treating voluntary reports, (c) research purposes, and (d) to improve the training of the Models, if Customer did not opt-out of having Customer’s Prompts and Outputs used to improve Mistral AI Training Data, which option is available only if the Customer subscribed to the Chat Paid Services, as provided for by Mistral AI’s Privacy Policy available on the Platform. If the Customer opted-out of the Mistral AI Training Data under applicable Terms, Mistral AI will not use information resulting from Customer’s Prompts and Outputs to improve the training of its Models. The Customer’s opt-out may only be effective for future Prompts and Outputs, as technical limitations inherent to the Chat Services may prevent Mistral AI from deleting all previously provided Prompts and Outputs from Mistral AI Training Data, even if the Customer has opted out. Mistral AI will inform the Data Subjects of such processing activities in its Privacy Policy.

* (a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.

* (e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a). For Module Three: The data exporter shall forward the notification to the controller.
    
* (f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfill its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation \[for Module Three:, if appropriate in consultation with the controller\]. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by \[for Module Three: the controller or\] the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.

    * (i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or
    * (ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.
* (b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.
    
* (c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.). \[For Module Three: The data exporter shall forward the information to the controller.\]
    
* (d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
    
* (e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.
    

**15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation**

* (a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).
* (b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
* (c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

SECTION IV – FINAL PROVISIONS
-----------------------------

### Clause 16

**Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination**

* (a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.
    
* (b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).
    

The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract,  
insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:

* (i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a  
    reasonable time and in any event within one month of  
    suspension;
* (ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of | these Clauses; or
* (iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.

In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory  
authority of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to  
termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the  
Parties have agreed otherwise.

* (d) The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.
* (e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
