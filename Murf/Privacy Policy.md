We process data globally and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. Countries where we process data may have laws which are different from, and potentially not as protective as, the laws of your own country.

##### **International transfers of personal information (for users in the Designated Countries)**

For our users in the Designated Countries, where we transfer your personal information to a third party provider that is not located in the Designated Country and is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, we will require those third party providers to enter into an agreement that provides appropriate safeguards for your information.

You may also access, review, update, rectify or delete your personal information by contacting us. We will respond to all requests within 30 days. Please note that deleting your personal information may limit our ability to provide the service to you.

We may limit or reject your request in certain cases, including without limitation where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case question, where the rights of other persons would be violated or as required by law or governance purposes.

If you need further assistance regarding your access and control of your personal information, please contact us.

##### **Security**

We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you send us. There is no guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

We generally retain your personal information as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services.

##### **Minors**

We do not knowingly advertise or collect personal information from any individual under the age of 13 and our services and content are not directed at children under the age of 13. For all users that are under the age of 16, we require the consent of a parent or legal guardian before that user can use our services. Our Terms of Use (available at [https://murf.ai/resources/terms\_of\_service](https://murf.ai/resources/terms_of_service)) has further details on this consent.

Our Site may allow access to third party content and services with your prior consent. We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services accessible from the Site, including the information or content contained within these websites or services. When you use a link to go from our Site to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services.

##### **Changes to our Privacy Policy**

We can modify this Privacy Policy, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. If you object to any changes, you may close your account or stop using our Services.

You acknowledge that your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to this Privacy Policy means that the collection, use and sharing of your personal information is subject to the updated Privacy Policy, as of its effective date.
