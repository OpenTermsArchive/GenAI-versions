**4.2 Voice Cloning**

[Voice cloning](https://murf.ai/voice-cloning) is a feature of Murf that allows you to use Cloning Voices to synthesize voice recordings that sound like a Consenting Speaker. A “**Cloning Voice**” is an AI model trained on voice recordings of a Consenting Speaker. A “**Consenting Speaker**” is a person (including you) who has given explicit written consent to use recordings of their voice to train a Cloning Voice and to synthesize their voice.

You may create new Cloning Voices by submitting voice recordings of a Consenting Speaker as training audio (“**Training Audio**”). By submitting Training Audio to Murf, you consent (and represent and warrant that you have obtained the explicit written consent of any third-party Consenting Speakers) to our use and storage of the audio recordings and voices you consent:

4.2.1 to use your voice, and the voice of any third-party Consenting Speakers, to train a Cloning Voice, to synthesize and use such voices as described here;

4.2.2 that Murf personnel, service providers and affiliates may listen to audio samples of your Training Audio and your synthesized audio in order to test the quality of your Cloning Voice; and

4.2.3 that Murf personnel, service providers and affiliates may use your Cloning Voice to create a series of non-defamatory utterances, solely for internal quality assurance purposes.

4.2.4 Only you and people you explicitly share access with will have access to generate synthesized audio using your Cloning Voice. Murf will not share your Training Audio or your Cloning Voice with anyone except as expressly described above.

4.2.5 The submission of a third party's unauthorized voice recordings as training audio is prohibited, and you agree that you will not submit any recording to Murf that contains the voice of any speakers that have not explicitly consented in writing to have their Cloning Voice created and to have their voices synthesized.
