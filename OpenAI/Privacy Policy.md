3\. Disclosure of personal information
--------------------------------------

In certain circumstances we may provide your Personal Information to third parties without further notice to you, unless required by the law:

* _Vendors and Service Providers_: To assist us in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services and functions, we may provide Personal Information to vendors and service providers, including providers of hosting services, customer service vendors, cloud services, email communication software, web analytics services, and other information technology providers, among others. Pursuant to our instructions, these parties will access, process, or store Personal Information only in the course of performing their duties to us.

* _Legal Requirements_: We may share your Personal Information, including information about your interaction with our Services, with government authorities, industry peers, or other third parties (i) if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) if we determine, in our sole discretion, that there is a violation of our terms, policies, or the law; (iv) to detect or prevent fraud or other illegal activity; (v) to protect the safety, security, and integrity of our products, employees, or users, or the public, or (vi) to protect against legal liability.
* _Affiliates_: We may disclose Personal Information to our affiliates, meaning an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with OpenAI. Our affiliates may use the Personal Information we share in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

For example, you may share ChatGPT conversations with other users via shared links or send information to third-party applications via custom actions for GPTs. Be sure you trust any user or third party with whom you share information.

4\. Your rights
---------------

Depending on location, individuals may have certain statutory rights in relation to their Personal Information. For example, you may have the right to:

* Access your Personal Information and information relating to how it is processed.
* Delete your Personal Information from our records.
* Rectify or update your Personal Information.
* Transfer your Personal Information to a third party (right to data portability).
* Restrict how we process your Personal Information.
* Withdraw your consent—where we rely on consent as the legal basis for processing at any time. 
* Object to how we process your Personal Information.
* Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

You can exercise some of these rights through your OpenAI account. If you are unable to exercise your rights through your account, please submit your request through [privacy.openai.com](https://privacy.openai.com/) or to [dsar@openai.com](mailto:dsar@openai.com).

A note about accuracy: Services like ChatGPT generate responses by reading a user’s request and, in response, predicting the words most likely to appear next. In some cases, the words most likely to appear next may not be the most factually accurate. For this reason, you should not rely on the factual accuracy of output from our models. If you notice that ChatGPT output contains factually inaccurate information about you and you would like us to correct the inaccuracy, you may submit a correction request through [privacy.openai.com](https://privacy.openai.com/) or to [dsar@openai.com](mailto:dsar@openai.com). Given the technical complexity of how our models work, we may not be able to correct the inaccuracy in every instance. In that case, you may request that we remove your Personal Information from ChatGPT’s output by filling out [this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1UPy6xqxZSEqTrGDh4ywo_g4sk30).

For information on how to exercise your rights with respect to data we have collected from the internet to train our models, please see [this help center article](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7842364-how-chatgpt-and-our-language-models-are-developed).

The Service may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by OpenAI, including social media services (“Third Party Sites”).

By providing these links we do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed these sites. Please contact the Third Party Sites directly for information on their privacy practices and policies.

8\. Security and Retention
--------------------------

We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect Personal Information both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from us may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via the Service or email. In addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Service, or third-party websites.  

We’ll retain your Personal Information for only as long as we need in order to provide our Service to you, or for other legitimate business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety and security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations. How long we retain Personal Information will depend on a number of factors, such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, our purpose for processing the information, and any legal requirements.
