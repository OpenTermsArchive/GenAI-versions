### 1\. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION

We collect and store personal identification information you choose to share with us, such as your email address or wallet address. We also collect information related to your use of our Services, such as the web application URL associated with model requests.

Users have the ability to opt out of logging prompts and completions, which are used to improve anonymous analytics features like classification. The [Privacy](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy) section of the account page controls this preference. Users can also request the deletion of prompts and completions by contacting us using our support@ email address.

### 2\. USE OF INFORMATION

We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:

* To set up and maintain your account
* To improve our services
* For billing purposes

### 3\. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

We do not share your personal information with third parties except for certain service providers, including analytics services (like Google Analytics) and third-party service providers (like Clerk). These third parties only have access to your information as necessary to perform their functions and are not permitted to use it for other purposes.

AI model providers generally store prompt data transiently or not at all, but a few provide lower pricing if they can collect prompts anonymously. To see the data policy of a given model provider, please visit it on the [models](https://openrouter.ai/models) page.

### 4\. USER RIGHTS AND CHOICES
