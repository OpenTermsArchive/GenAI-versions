Terms of Service
================

Last updated: 2023-08-09
------------------------

This agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between you ("User" or "Developer") and OpenRouter, Inc ("Company", "We", "Us", or "Our"), a Delaware C-corporation. By using our services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.

### 1\. SERVICES

OpenRouter is an AI model aggregator, providing an API and a chat interface at openrouter.ai ("Services"). The API can be used by developers to interact with a variety of large language models, generative image models, and generative 3D object models. Applications that developers build can be shown publicly on OpenRouter.

OpenRouter is in beta; we may change or discontinue any part of the Services at any time, including the availability of certain models.

Some models are marked as "experimental" on their model pages - these models are being evaluated to see if they receive enough usage to be economical for us to run. They may be removed at any time.

If a non-experimental model needs to be removed, you can expect the following:

1. We will provide a notification in the OpenRouter community [Discord](https://discord.gg/fVyRaUDgxW) server.
2. For a certain period of time, we will re-route requests for that model to another model of similar price and capability.
3. After a grace period of at least 2 weeks, we will stop re-routing requests for that model and will return a 404 error instead.

### 2\. USERS AND DEVELOPERS

For the purpose of this Agreement, "Users" are individuals who interact with AI models and generate content with them. "Developers" are individuals or entities who build on top of OpenRouter's APIs. Either party can pay for model usage.

### 3\. OBLIGATIONS

Use of OpenRouter by anyone under 13 years of age is prohibited. You represent that you are at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction where you live or, if you are not, your parent or legal guardian must consent to these OpenRouter Terms of Service and affirm that they accept these Terms on your behalf and bear responsibility for your use. Bots accessed via OpenRouter may produce content that is not suitable for minors. If you are accepting these OpenRouter Terms of Service on behalf of someone else or an entity, you confirm that you have the legal authority to bind that person or entity to these Terms.

You agree not to use OpenRouter to:

* Violate the rights of another party or any applicable laws;
* Violate any of these Terms or our policies, or policies of third-party providers that power the models on OpenRouter, which can be found by visiting [the documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs).
* Reverse assemble, reverse compile, decompile, translate or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying components of models, algorithms, and systems of OpenRouter, the models, or their underlying technologies;
* Abuse, harm, interfere with, reverse engineer, or disrupt OpenRouter, the models, or their underlying technologies, such as by accessing or using them in fraudulent or deceptive ways, introducing malware, or spamming, hacking, or bypassing any protective measures;
* Use OpenRouter or the models in a prohibitied fashion, such as by exceeding any rate limits set forth by us from time to time, or by repeatedly creating accounts without paying for access;
* Use any method to extract data from OpenRouter, including web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction methods, other than as permitted by these OpenRouter Terms of Service; or
* Represent that OpenRouter-Generated Content is human-generated.

### 4\. PAYMENT

Developers can pay for models themselves, or they can have Users pay by using the OAuth flow to let Users sign in with their OpenRouter settings and billing. Pricing for models is available [here](https://openrouter.ai/models), and varies by model and whether a discount is applied.

Users can pay for models by purchasing credits using a payment card or crypto wallet. Credits are non-refundable. Credits can be used to pay for models, and can be topped up at any time. While OpenRouter is in beta, credits may expire 12 months after purchase.

OpenRouter uses Stripe to securely process non-crypto payments. See their [terms of service](https://stripe.com/legal/end-users). Credits purchased via credit card incur a total fee of 5% + $0.35.

In the event that we receive a fraud dispute on one of your payments, or any chargeback related to fraud, you will lose credits equal to the amount of the chargeback plus the fee levied by Stripe for handling the dispute (currently $15).

If you are a business and would like invoices for each payment, Stripe charges an additional fee of 0.4% per invoice, capped at $2 per transaction.

OpenRouter uses Coinbase to process crypto payments. On each top-up payment you make, Coinbase charges a fee of 1%, and OpenRouter charges 4% + $0. We do not have access to your crypto wallet, apart from the address you send payment from.

When using your own provider API keys (via [integrations](https://openrouter.ai/settings/integrations)), we will deduct credits from your account equal to 5% of the cost of the request, calculated using the pricing listed on OpenRouter at the time of the request.

We may change our pricing at any time. If we do, we will provide notice of the change on the OpenRouter website or Services.

### 5\. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

By using our Services, no intellectual property rights are transferred to the User or Developer. All rights, titles, and interests in and to the Services, including any software, technology or processes, belong solely to OpenRouter, Inc.

All material that you upload, publish, or display within OpenRouter, and any results that you receive in response to your prompts (or other inputs) from models accessible via OpenRouter ("Model-Generated Content"), will collectively be considered "Your Content." You retain ownership of Your Content.

### 6\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, or your relationship with OpenRouter under these Terms of Service, shall be resolved by binding arbitration. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.

### 7\. PRIVACY POLICY

Our [Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy) is a separate document that explains how we collect, use, and protect User information. It forms part of these Terms of Service and is incorporated herein by reference.

### 8\. LIABILITY

OpenRouter, Inc is not liable for any damages, loss, or problems that arise out of or are related to the use of its Services.

### 9\. MODIFICATION

We may modify these Terms of Service at any time without notice. Your continued use of our Services following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the changes.

### 10\. TERMINATION

We may terminate your use of the Services at any time and for any reason, including for a violation of these Terms of Service, upon providing notice to you. You may terminate your use of the Services at any time by ceasing to use our Services.

Upon termination, all rights and obligations will be extinguished other than such rights and obligations which by their nature should survive, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution provisions.
