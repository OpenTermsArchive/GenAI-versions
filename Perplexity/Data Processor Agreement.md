If the Customer does object within five days, the Customer and Perplexity shall work together in good faith to agree upon a resolution to the objection (e.g. restricting use of Personal Data or the Customer temporarily or permanently not using a particular aspect or feature of the Services). If despite those good faith discussions, a resolution cannot be found, then Customer (as its sole remedy) may terminate the Agreement, and receive a refund of any unused prepaid Fees (as defined in the Agreement).

If Customer objects to the appointment or replacement, Customer’s sole recourse is to (and Customer must) cease all use of the relevant Third-Party Model via the Services (which, for clarity, Customer may do at any time after the appointment or replacement).  
          
        
    4. Perplexity shall engage subcontractors only pursuant to a written agreement that contains obligations on the subcontractor which are no less onerous on the relevant subcontractor than the obligations on Perplexity under this DPA.  
          
        
    5. In the event Perplexity engages a subcontractor to carry out specific processing activities on behalf of Customer pursuant to EU/UK Privacy Laws, where that subcontractor fails to fulfil its obligations, Perplexity shall remain fully liable under applicable EU/UK Privacy Laws to Customer for the performance of that subcontractor’s obligations.

    1. notifying Customer of requests from individuals pursuant to their rights under Privacy Laws, including by providing, deleting or correcting the relevant Personal Data, or by enabling Customer to do the same, insofar as this is possible**;  
        **  
        
    2. to the extent required by Privacy Laws, conducting data protection impact assessments and, if required, prior consultation with relevant competent authorities; and

8. **Security Measures**. Perplexity shall, taking into account the state-of-the-art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, implement appropriate technical, physical and organizational measures designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk, as set out in Annex 3, or otherwise agreed and documented between Customer and Perplexity from time to time, and shall continue to comply with them during the term of the Agreement. Perplexity shall provide data protection and security training to those employees and other persons authorized to access Personal Data.   
      
    
9. **Access and Audits**. Upon reasonable written request of Customer and to the extent required of Perplexity by Privacy Laws, Perplexity shall allow for and contribute to inspections and audits regarding Perplexity’s compliance with its obligations under this DPA and Privacy Laws by, on Customer’s request, providing to Customer such information in Perplexity’s possession as is reasonably necessary to demonstrate such compliance and/or arranging for a qualified and independent auditor to conduct an assessment of Perplexity’s policies and technical and organizational measures for such compliance, using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Vendor be required to give Customer access to information, facilities or systems to the extent doing so would cause Vendor to be in violation of confidentiality obligations owed to other customers or its legal obligations.  
      
    
10. **Deletion of Personal Data**.   Perplexity shall delete (or, at Customer’s option, return) all Personal Data within thirty days of the end of the provision of the Services to Customer, unless retention of the Personal Data is required by law, in which case, Perplexity shall notify Customer without undue delay of such legal requirement and shall upon the expiration of such retention obligation delete (or, at Customer’s option, return) the Personal Data.
