**Information Collected Automatically:**

  

We and certain third parties also automatically collect certain information about your interaction with the Services (“**Usage Data**”) through the use of cookies, pixels, tags and other tracking technologies (“**Tracking Technologies**”). Usage Data includes:

* Device information, such as device type, operating system, unique device identifier, and internet protocol (IP) address.

We use Usage Data in our legitimate interests to tailor features and content to you, run analytics and measure and better understand user interaction with the Services, and we may permit third parties to use Usage Data for such purposes. For more information on how we use Tracking Technologies and your choices, see the section below, Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.

  

**Information Collected From Other Sources:** 

  

We may obtain information about you from outside sources, including information that we collect directly from third parties and information from third parties that you choose to share with us. Such information includes:

* Analytics data we receive from analytics providers such as Google Analytics (“**Analytics Information**”), which we use in our legitimate interests to understand your interaction with, and improve, our Services.
    

* Information we receive from career websites, such as LinkedIn, Monster, or Indeed, which we use in our legitimate interests to process your application for employment (“**Employment Information**”). For Singapore, we use this information for evaluative purposes and for the purposes of entering into an employment relationship with you.
    

* Information we receive from consumer marketing databases or other data enrichment companies, which we use in our legitimate interests to better customize advertising and marketing to you (“**Advertising Information**”).
    

* Information we receive from business partners and other companies that we partner with to provide you with free or discounted access to the Services or other offers or promotions, which we use in our legitimate interests to provide you with free or discounted access to the Services (“**Partner Information**”).
    

* Information we receive when you choose to link any third-party platforms to your account, such as when you sign into your account through Google or Apple (“**Third Party Platform Information**”). We use this information only where necessary to perform our contract with you, to maintain your account and login information and to provide you with the Services, including to generate and output new content.  Third Party Platform Information may includes your name, profile picture and email address.
    

* Information from publicly accessible sources, such as information that’s publicly available online (like articles, websites, and journals) or from other public sources, which we use where necessary to perform our contract with you (“**Public Information**”).
    

  

In addition to the specific uses described above, we may use any of the above information to provide you with and improve the Services (including our AI models) and to maintain our business relationship, including by enhancing the safety and security of our Services (e.g., troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, system maintenance, and reporting), providing customer support, sending service and other non-marketing communications, monitoring and analyzing trends, and conducting internal research and development. We may also use the information to comply with applicable legal obligations, enforce any applicable terms of service, and protect the Services, our rights, and the rights of our employees, users or other individuals.

  

You may also have the ability to sync your third party email account or calendar (such as Gmail and Google Calendar) with the Services. If you choose to sync these accounts, we will have access to your contacts and information from the email messages and calendar appointments in your email account, including the content of your emails (together, “**Email Service Information**”). Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, we only use and disclose Email Service Information to provide the Services or as otherwise required by applicable law, and we do not use or disclose Email Service Information to create, train, improve or fine-tune AI models. If you sync your Google account with the Services, we only use and disclose information from your Google account in accordance with the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

  

Finally, we may, in our legitimate interests, deidentify or anonymize your information such that it cannot reasonably be used to infer information about you or otherwise be linked to you (“**Deidentified Information**”) (or we may collect information that has already been deidentified/anonymized), and we may use such Deidentified Information for any purpose. To the extent we possess or process any deidentified information, we will maintain and use such information in deidentified/anonymized form and not attempt to reidentify the information, except solely for the purpose of determining whether our deidentification/anonymization process satisfies legal requirements.

  

Any information we receive from outside sources will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the accuracy of the information provided to us by third parties and are not responsible for any third party’s policies or practices. For more information, see the section below, Third Party Websites and Links. To the extent the laws in your jurisdiction do not recognize the legal basis of legitimate interest or another legal basis specified above for a particular purpose, you consent to the processing of your personal data for that purpose through using the Services.

Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Services, and we do not seek or knowingly collect any personal information about children, particularly those under 13 years of age or in the case of a region where the minimum age for processing personal information differs, such different age. For users above the age of 13 but below the age where you are able to consent to the processing of your personal information, please obtain your parent or guardian’s consent prior to using the Services.

8. DATA SECURITY AND RETENTION
    ---------------------------
    

  

Despite our reasonable efforts to protect your information, no security measures are impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee “perfect security.” Any information you send to us electronically, while using the Services or otherwise interacting with us, may not be secure while in transit. We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to send us sensitive or confidential information. 

  

We retain your information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. When determining the length of time to retain your information, we consider various criteria, including whether we need the information to continue to provide you the Services, resolve a dispute, enforce our contractual agreements, prevent harm, promote safety, security and integrity, or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products.  
  

9. U.S. RESIDENTS
    --------------
    

  

This section supplements the other sections of this Privacy Policy and applies to you only if you are a resident of California or another U.S. state that has passed a privacy law similar to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“**CCPA**”) that applies to us, and the law requires specific privacy notice disclosures. For purposes of this section, references to “**personal information**” shall include “**sensitive personal information**,” as these terms are defined under the CCPA.

  

**Processing of Personal Information:**

  

In the preceding 12 months, we collected and disclosed for a business purpose the following categories of personal information and sensitive personal information (denoted by \*) about residents:

* Identifiers, such as name, e-mail address and IP address
    
* Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute such as name, address and telephone number

* Internet or other similar network activity such as Usage Data

The third parties that we have disclosed your information to are described in Section 4 (Disclosure of Your Information) above. We only use and disclose sensitive personal information for the purposes specified in the CCPA or otherwise in line with your consent. The criteria we use to determine how long to retain your personal information is described in the section above, Data Security and Retention. 

  

**Selling and/or Sharing of Personal Information:** 

  

**We do not “sell” or “share” (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) personal information, nor have we done so in the preceding 12 months.** Further, we do not have actual knowledge that we “sell” or “share” personal information of residents under 16 years of age. 

  

**California Account Holders Under 18:**

  

Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Services and who have posted content or information available to others on the Services can request that such information be removed from the Services by contacting us at the e-mail address set forth in the section below, How to Contact Us. Such request must state that they personally posted such content or information and detail where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the resident cannot be individually identified. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have republished the post, and archived copies of it may be stored by search engines and other parties that we do not control.

  

10. DATA TRANSFERS
    --------------
    

  

The personal information that we collect will be transferred to, stored at/processed in, or accessed from countries outside the jurisdiction in which you are based in, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including countries in which our service providers or other third parties described in Section 4 are located. Specifically, we have servers for the Service in the US. We also have support, engineering and other teams who may support the Service, including from the United States.

  

We process the personal information that you provide to us by creating an account and using our Services in countries outside the relevant jurisdiction you are resident in in order to perform our contract with you (to provide you with our Services). By using the Services and acknowledging the Privacy Policy, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to third parties (if any), which may include the cross-border transfer of your information to any country or region where we have databases or affiliates and, in particular, to the jurisdictions specified herein. For such transfers of data outside the relevant jurisdiction will use applicable safeguards, for example,  for UK and EEA users, the European Commission’s model contracts for the transfer of personal information to third countries (i.e., the standard contractual clauses) (the “**Model Clauses**”), or any equivalent contracts issued by the relevant competent authority of the UK, as relevant, unless the data transfer is to a country that has been determined by the European Commission or the relevant UK authorities, as applicable, to provide an adequate level of protection for individuals’ rights and freedoms for their personal information. Please contact us at [support@perplexity.ai](mailto:support@perplexity.ai) should you wish to inquire further as to such data transfer mechanisms, including to examine a copy of the Model Clauses.  

  

**For EU and UK users:**

  

We comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, the “DPF”) and have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the DPF Principles with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and UK (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the DPF.

  

If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern to the extent applicable to the information at issue. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over our compliance with the DPF and, in accordance with the DPF, we are responsible for onward transfers to third parties that process personal information subject to the DPF in a way that does not follow the DPF Principles. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, and to view our certification, please visit the Data Privacy Framework website.

  

We commit to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of personal information. Individuals in the EU and UK with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the DPF should first contact us, at support@perplexity.ai. If you have an unresolved complaint concerning our handling of personal information received in reliance on the DPF that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/. Under certain conditions (more fully described here) you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, we commit to cooperate and comply respectively with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.
