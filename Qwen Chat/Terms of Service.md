    * 2\. We are continuously working to develop and improve our Services. We may update these Terms or our Services (or any part thereof) accordingly from time to time. For example, we may make changes to these Terms or the Services due to:

        * 2.2 Security or safety reasons;
        * 2.3 Circumstances beyond our reasonable control;

        We may notify you of changes to our Terms by updating the Terms on our website, via email to you, and/or through any other means that we believe to be appropriate.
        
        All other changes to these Terms will be effective as soon as these Terms are updated on our website. If you do not agree to the changes, you must immediately stop accessing and using our Services, and must immediately instruct us in writing to terminate your account.

    * 3\. You and Alibaba are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.
    * 4\. We may decide to discontinue our Services without advance notice.
    * 5\. The illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms under the law of any jurisdiction shall not affect its legality, validity or enforceability under the law of any other jurisdiction nor the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision. The provisions of these Terms are severable, and if any provision, or any portion thereof, is determined by a competent court or tribunal to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any reason, any remaining portion of that provision, and all other provisions of these Terms, shall remain legal, valid, and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in order to give effect to the parties' intentions.
    * 6\. Alibaba’s omission or delay in enforcing any or part of our rights in relation to these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof.

Unless any right or remedy of ours is expressed to be an exclusive right or remedy, all of our rights and remedies under these Terms shall be without prejudice to our other rights and remedies at law and/or in equity.
    * 7\. You shall not delegate, assign, sub-license or sub-contract any of the rights and/or obligations under these Terms to any third party without our prior written consent.
