Customer hereby authorizes Replicate (or its payment processor) to charge Customer’s designated Payment Method for any amounts owed pursuant to this Agreement. We offer two billing models: (1) Payment in Arrears and (2) Prepaid Credit. Your Account or other parts of the user interface of the Services will indicate which billing model applies to your use of the Services.

(c) Payment in Arrears Billing Model.

(i) If your Account or other parts of the user interface of the Services specifies the Payment in Arrears billing model, at the beginning of each month, we will charge the Payment Method on file for the Services you used in the month prior

(ii) To the extent indicated in your Account or other parts of the user interface of the Services, you may have the option to purchase the Prepaid Balance (as defined below) in which case the terms related thereto set forth in Section 4.1(d) shall apply to you.

(d) Prepaid Credit Billing Model.

(i) If your Account or other parts of the user interface of the Services specifies the Prepaid Credit billing model, Customer will be required to prepay an amount of its choosing (“Prepaid Balance”) via the Payment Method in Customer’s Account. The Prepaid Balance will be applied against fees incurred by Customer based on its actual usage of the Services. All fees for Customer’s usage of the Services shall be debited from the Prepaid Balance as they accrue. Customer may view its current balance and usage in its Account.

(ii) Customer may elect to enable an auto-reload feature within its Account settings. If enabled, Customer may specify threshold and top-up parameters (e.g., "if balance falls below $100, reload to $150"), and Replicate is authorized to automatically charge Customer’s designated Payment Method in accordance with such instructions. Customer remains responsible for ensuring that Payment Method information is accurate and up to date, and that sufficient funds are available for successful reloading. Replicate shall not be liable for any service disruption resulting from a failed auto-reload.

(iii) Each payment to fund the Prepaid Balance will expire at the end of twelfth (12th) month after the date of payment if not fully used. Upon expiration, any unused amounts will be forfeited and will not be refunded or credited to Customer. It is Customer’s responsibility to monitor its usage and ensure timely application of funds.

(iv) If Customer's usage results in charges that exceed the Prepaid Balance (such excess, the “Overage”), such Overage shall be invoiced to Customer at the beginning of the following calendar month and shall be payable via the Payment Method on file. Replicate may charge Customer’s Payment Method for any Overage at that time.

(v) If the Prepaid Balance is depleted and Customer does not replenish it or fails to pay the Overage when due, Replicate reserves the right to suspend Customer’s access to the Services, in whole or in part, without liability, until payment is received or the Prepaid Balance is restored.

(vi) All Prepaid Balances are non-refundable, except as otherwise required by law or as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

(e) We have certain billing policies to prevent fraudulent use of our Services. For instance, if your usage exceeds certain thresholds for the first time, or after you change your payment method, we may charge you prior to the month end for your usage in such month. Any early charges will show up as a credit on your invoice when it is issued.

(f) Our billing practices may change from time to time. We will always update our Website in respect of any such change. For details on our billing practices for the use of Models, please review: [Billing](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/billing#language-models).

Exceptions. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY WARRANTIES WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

**8\. SUSPENSION & TERMINATION.**

**8.1 Term.**

These Terms commence on the earlier of the date you first open an Account to use the Services or the date when you accepted these Terms by any other applicable action in relation to our Website, and these Terms will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services, unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Section 8.

**8.2 Termination by Replicate.**

If you have breached any provision of these Terms, if Replicate is required to do so by Law (e.g., where the provision of the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), or if it is commercially impractical for Replicate to provide the Services, Replicate shall at its discretion, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate any of the Services provided to you.

**8.3 Termination by You.**

Other than the clauses noted under Section 8.5, these Terms shall not apply to you upon the earlier of the termination or deletion of Customer’s Account and in case Customer is an entity, each of its Authorized Users’ Accounts.

**8.4 Effect of Termination.**

If Services are terminated for any reason, your use rights shall cease, and you may not be able to access your Account and all related information or files associated with or inside your Account (or any part thereof) may be deleted. Customer will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination.

**8.5 Survival.**

Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of these Terms, any provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination or expiration will continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding such termination or expiration until they are satisfied or by their nature expire. This includes, but is not limited to, this Section 8.5, Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 of these Terms and any other obligations that may reasonably be expected to be performed or observed after such termination or expiration.

**9\. INDEMNIFICATION.**

**9.1 Indemnification.**

Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Replicate and itsofficers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns (each, a “**Replicate Indemnitee**”) from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Replicate Indemnitee resulting from Customer’s use of the Services, including in respect of any Action that relates to or arises out of or results from:

(a) Customer Data, including any Inputs, Outputs, and processing of Customer Data by a Model;

(b) breach of Third Party Terms;

(c) any other materials or information (including any documents, data, specifications, software, content, or technology) provided by or on behalf of Customer;

(d) allegation of facts that, if true, would constitute Customer's breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations under these Terms;

(e) negligence, or more culpable act or omission (including recklessness or willful misconduct) by Customer, any Authorized User, or any third party on behalf of Customer, in connection with these Terms.

**9.2 Indemnification Procedure.**

Customer shall promptly assume control of the defense of applicable Actions, and shall employ counsel of its choice to handle and defend the same, at Customer’s sole cost and expense. Replicate may participate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense with counsel of its own choosing. Customer shall not settle any Action on any terms or in any manner that adversely affects the rights of a Replicate Indemnitee without such party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If Customer fails or refuses to assume control of the defense of such Action, Replicate Indemnitees shall have the right, but no obligation, to defend against such Action, including settling such Action after giving notice to Customer, in each case in such manner and on such terms as the Replicate Indemnitees may deem appropriate. The Replicate Indemnitee’s failure to perform any obligations under this Section 9.2 will not relieve Customer of its obligations under this Section 9, except to the extent that the Customer can demonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

**9.3 Mitigation.**

If any of the Services are, or in Replicate's opinion are likely to be, claimed to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third-party Intellectual Property Right, or if Customer's use of the Services is enjoined or threatened to be enjoined, Customer’s sole remedy is to terminate its Account and cease any use of the Services.
