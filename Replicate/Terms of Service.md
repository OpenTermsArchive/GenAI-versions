The Services are only available to Customers who can form legally binding contracts under Law. You are not eligible to be a Customer either directly or indirectly if you are barred from using the Services under the Laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, including pursuant to Section 12.8 (Compliance with Laws and Export Regulations) in these Terms.

**2.2 Features and Benefits.**

(a) Among other benefits of our Services, you can access and run Models which are either private (proprietary to Customer or Replicate) or public open-sourced Models that may be found on platforms such as GitHub or Hugging Face as further set out on the Website (see our disclaimers in Section 8 regarding Models). You can create Customer Derivative Models or build and publish custom Models from scratch. For more information on how Models are built on Replicate, what tools we use, how you can deploy Models and other useful information for your use of our Services, please refer to our [Website](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work).

(b) In addition to using the Models, Customers can obtain more control over how they run a Model by allowing deployments of a Model (“**Deployments**”) on the Services which allow Customer to: roll out new versions of a Model without having to edit code; auto-scale Models to handle extra load and scale to zero when Models are not being used, saving cost; keep instances always on to avoid cold boots; customize what hardware the Models runs on; monitor whether instances are setting up, idle, or processing predictions; monitor the predictions that are flowing through the Model; and also limit the maximum number of instances the Deployment can use to limit Customer’s maximum spend, or set a minimum to keep some instances warm and ready for predictions.

(c) You can try [featured models](https://replicate.com/explore#featured-models) out on Replicate for free, but some features are only available to customers with billing set up. See Section 44 for clauses related to fees.

(d) Our Website Documentation includes guidance documents and weekly bulletins that are available on our Website subject to the rights granted under these Terms or as explicitly set out on the Website.We grant you a sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable, fully paid up license to use the foregoing solely for your and your Representatives’ non-commercial purposes.

(b) You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and Login Credentials, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or Account. You are responsible for any and all activities or actions that occur under your Account and/or Login Credentials, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service. You must notify us immediately at [support@replicate.com](mailto:support@replicate.com) upon becoming aware of any actual or potential breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account or Login Credentials.

(c) Replicate may suspend, terminate, or otherwise deny Customer's or any Authorized User's access to or use of all or any part of the Services, without incurring any resulting obligation or liability, if: (a) Replicate receives a judicial or other governmental demand or order, subpoena, or law enforcement request that expressly or by reasonable implication requires Replicate to do so; or (b) Replicate believes, in its discretion, that: (i) Customer has failed to comply with any material term of these Terms, or accessed or used the Services beyond the scope of the rights granted or for a purpose not authorized under these Terms or in any manner that does not comply with any Documentation; or (ii) Customer is, has been, or is likely to be involved in any fraudulent, misleading, or unlawful activities relating to or in connection with any of the Services.

**2.4 Subscriptions**

Some parts of the Services are billed on a subscription basis with automatically recuring payments for periodic charges (“**Subscription(s)**”). The “**Subscription Billing Date**” is the date when you purchase your first Subscription to the Services. The Subscription will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period that you select on your Account (such period, the “**Initial Subscription Period**”), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a “**Subscription Period**”) unless you cancel the Subscription or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription, then you authorize Replicate or its Payment Processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your Subscription for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Period to your account. Replicate or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription fee to the payment method associated with your Account or that you otherwise provide to us.

We may in our sole discretion and at any time, modify fees for any Subscriptions we offer for any part of our Service. Any Subscription fee change will become effective upon the next renewal Subscription Period. Replicate will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

**4\. FEES AND PAYMENT.**

(a) You may be charged fees for your use of the Services and for your use of Marketplace Models. We may in our sole discretion and at any time, modify Subscription fees for any subscriptions we offer for any part of our Service. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription Period.

You may also receive access to certain features that we are trying out in beta. All Services are subject to our disclaimers. Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount. You can find your current usage and manage your billing settings on your Account.

**4.2 Billing.**

Customer will be required to set up billing by providing an accepted payment method, including but not limited to credit card, debit card or bank transfer (collectively, “**Payment Method**”) and authorizing us to charge Customer for their use of our Services or a Marketplace Model. Customer hereby authorizes Replicate (or its payment processor) to charge Customer’s designated Payment Method for any amounts owed pursuant to this Agreement. We offer two billing models: (1) Payment in Arrears and (2) Prepaid Credit. Your Account or other parts of the user interface of the Services will indicate which billing model applies to your use of the Services.

(a) **Payment in Arrears Billing Model.**

(i) If your Account or other parts of the user interface of the Services specifies the “**Payment in Arrears**” billing model, at the beginning of each month, we will charge the Payment Method on file for the Services (including your use of a Marketplace Model) you used in the month prior.

(ii) To the extent indicated in your Account or other parts of the user interface of the Services, you may have the option to purchase the Prepaid Balance (as defined below) in which case the terms related thereto set forth in Section 4.2(c) shall apply to you.

**Prepaid Credit Billing Model.**

(iii) If your Account or other parts of the user interface of the Services specifies the “**Prepaid Credit**” billing model, Customer will be required to prepay an amount of its choosing (“**Prepaid Balance**”) via the Payment Method in Customer’s Account. The Prepaid Balance will be applied against fees incurred by Customer based on its actual usage of the Services or Marketplace Models. All fees for Customer’s usage of the Services or Marketplace Models shall be debited from the Prepaid Balance as they accrue. Customer may view its current balance and usage in its Account. Prepaid Credits: (a) do not constitute or confer upon you any personal property right; (b) are not redeemable, refundable, or exchangeable for any sum of money or monetary value (except where required by law); and (c) are not legal tender or currency, have no equivalent value in fiat currency, and are not a substitute for fiat currency. Prepaid Credits are non-transferable and may be used only in connection with the applicable Service(s) or Marketplace Models for which they were issued. We may offer promotional Prepaid Credits free of charge as part of a promotional program rather than for purchase and such Prepaid Credits will not be applied against any sales, use, gross receipts, or similar transaction based taxes that may be applicable to you. All sales of Prepaid Credits are final.

(iv) Customer may elect to enable an auto-reload feature within its Account settings. If enabled, Customer may specify threshold and top-up parameters (e.g., “if balance falls below $100, reload to $150”), and Replicate or its Payment Processor is authorized to automatically charge Customer’s designated Payment Method in accordance with such instructions. Customer remains responsible for ensuring that Payment Method information is accurate and up to date, and that sufficient funds are available for successful reloading. Replicate shall not be liable for any service disruption resulting from a failed auto-reload.

(v) Each payment to fund the Prepaid Balance will expire at the end of twelfth (12th) month after the date of payment if not fully used. Upon expiration, any unused amounts will be forfeited and will not be refunded or credited to Customer. It is Customer’s responsibility to monitor its usage and ensure timely application of funds.

(vi) If Customer’s usage results in charges that exceed the Prepaid Balance (such excess, the “**Overage**”), such Overage shall be invoiced to Customer at the beginning of the following calendar month and shall be payable via the Payment Method on file. Replicate or its Payment Processor is authorized to charge Customer’s Payment Method for any Overage.

(vii) If the Prepaid Balance is depleted and Customer does not replenish it or fails to pay the Overage when due, Replicate reserves the right to suspend Customer’s access to the Services, in whole or in part, without liability, until payment is received or the Prepaid Balance is restored.

(viii) All Prepaid Balances are non-refundable, except as otherwise required by law or as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

(b) We have certain billing policies to prevent fraudulent use of our Services. For instance, if your usage exceeds certain thresholds for the first time, or after you change your payment method, we may charge you prior to the month end for your usage in such month. Any early charges will show up as a credit on your invoice when it is issued.

(c) Any disputes regarding fees charged by Replicate pursuant these Terms must be brought by Customer within the greater of: (a) 30 days following the payment due date; or (b) the number of days following the payment due date permitted under applicable Law.

(f) Our billing practices may change from time to time. We will always update our Website in respect of any such change. For details on our billing practices for the use of Models, please review: [Billing](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/billing#language-models).

**4.3 Taxes.**

All Fees and other amounts payable by Customer are exclusive of taxes and similar assessments. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer is responsible for all sales, use, and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties, and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental or regulatory authority on any amounts payable by Customer to Replicate, other than any taxes imposed on Replicate’s income.

**4.4 Payment Processing.**

Replicate may utilize third-party payment processors (“**Payment Processors**”) to facilitate transactions for the Services (including for Marketplace Models). By using the Service and making payments, Customer agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the applicable Payment Processor. Customer acknowledges and understands that the Payment Processor may collect and process certain information from Customer, including but not limited to Customer’s payment information, billing address, and transaction history, in accordance with their privacy policy. This information is collected and processed by the Payment Processor for the purpose of facilitating payment transactions and preventing fraud. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Replicate shall not be liable for any errors, omissions, or security breaches related to the Payment Processor’s services or the Payment Processor’s use of Customer’s information. Any disputes related to the processing of any payments you make should be addressed directly with the Payment Processor in accordance with their terms of service. Replicate may use Stripe, Inc. (“**Stripe**”) as our Payment Processor ([https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com/)). For specific details regarding Stripe’s services, please refer to the following links: Stripe services agreement: [https://stripe.com/legal/consumer](https://stripe.com/legal/consumer) and Stripe privacy policy: [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy). Customer understands that the Payment Processor may modify its services and terms and conditions at any time. Replicate is not responsible for any changes made by the Payment Processor that may affect Customer’s use of the Services. Replicate reserves the right to change our Payment Processor at any time.

**4.5 Late Payment.**

If Customer fails to make any payment when due then, in addition to all other remedies that may be available, Replicate may charge interest on the past due amount at the rate of 1.5% per month calculated daily and compounded monthly or, if lower, the highest rate permitted under Law, and Customer shall reimburse Replicate for all reasonable costs incurred by Replicate in collecting any late payments or interest, including attorneys’ fees, court costs, and collection agency fees. If such failure continues for 30 days following written notice thereof, Replicate may suspend performance of the Services until all past due amounts and interest thereon have been paid, without incurring any obligation or liability to Customer or any other person by reason of such suspension.

**4.6 No Deductions or Setoffs.**

All amounts payable to Replicate by Customer shall be paid in full without any setoff, recoupment, counterclaim, deduction, debit, or withholding for any reason.

**5\. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP.**

**5.1 Customer Data.**

As between Customer and Replicate, Customer owns and will continue to own all rights, title, and interest, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to its applicable Customer Data, and nothing set out under these Terms shall in any way transfer any right in a Customer Data to any other entity.

8.3 Compliance and Infringement. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SERVICES UTILIZE THIRD-PARTY OFFERINGS THAT REPLICATE HAS NO CONTROL OVER, AND ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTENT, PRIVACY POLICIES, OR PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTY WEB SITES OR SERVICES.

REPLICATE DISCLAIMS THAT ANY THIRD PARTY OFFERINGS OR OTHER THIRD PARTY MATERIAL SHALL BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. REPLICATE ENCOURAGES ITS CUSTOMERS TO ENSURE THAT OUTPUT GENERATED BY THE SERVICES ARE IN FACT NOT SUBJECT TO THIRD PARTY COPYRIGHT RIGHTS, BY HUMAN REVIEW IF NECESSARY, AS MODELS ARE CAPABLE OF GENERATING CONTENT WHICH MAY INCLUDE COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS.

THE PARTIES FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AREAS OF LAW WHICH APPLY TO THE SERVICES ARE EVOLVING RAPIDLY IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS. REPLICATE’S COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS IN ONE JURISDICTION MAY NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL JURISDICTIONS.

8.4 Reliance. REPLICATE FURTHER DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM REPLICATE OR ITS EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS, INCLUDING GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN THE DOCUMENTATION, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

THE SERVICES ARE CAPABLE OF GENERATING SOME CONTENT THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE, OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, SUGGESTIVE, PORNOGRAPHIC, LASCIVIOUS, VIOLENT, GRAPHIC, OR RELATED TO FETISHES AND /OR NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN. REPLICATE DOES NOT CONDONE OR IN ANY WAY ENCOURAGE SUCH CONTENT CREATION. REPLICATE DOES NOT MONITOR THE CREATION OF SUCH OR ANY CONTENT SPECIFICALLY FOR UNACCEPTABILITY AND CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL CONTENT OUTPUT BY SERVICES AND THIRD-PARTY OFFERINGS DUE TO CUSTOMER’S USE IS CUSTOMER’S TO MANAGE, AND AS APPROPRIATE, DELETE, QUARANTINE AND PREVENT FROM FURTHER DISTRIBUTION AND DISSEMINATION.

CUSTOMER WILL NOT RELY ON THE MODELS, OUTPUT, OR ANY RECOMMENDATION AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ITS OWN INDEPENDENT DETERMINATIONS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTS OR OMISSIONS CUSTOMER UNDERTAKES BASED ON RECOMMENDATIONS, OUTPUTS, AND OTHER INFORMATION CUSTOMER RECEIVES FROM THE MODELS.

8.10 Exceptions. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY WARRANTIES WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

**9\. SUSPENSION & TERMINATION.**

**9.1 Term.**

These Terms commence on the earlier of the date you first open an Account to use the Services or the date when you accepted these Terms by any other applicable action in relation to our Website, and these Terms will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services, unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Section 9.

**9.2 Termination by Replicate.**

If you have breached any provision of these Terms, if Replicate is required to do so by Law (e.g., where the provision of the Services is, or becomes, unlawful) or if it is commercially impractical for Replicate to provide the Services, Replicate may at its discretion, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate these Terms and any of the Services provided to you.

**9.3 Termination by You.**

You may terminate these Terms at any time by deleting your Account and, if applicable, your Authorized Users’ Account(s).

**9.4 Effect of Termination.**

If these Terms are terminated for any reason: (a) your use rights shall cease and you must immediately cease all use of the Services; (b) you may not be able to access your Account and all related information or files associated with or inside your Account (or any part thereof) may be deleted; and (c) you must pay Replicate any unpaid amount that was due prior to termination.

**9.5 Survival.**

Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of these Terms, any provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination or expiration will continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding such termination or expiration until they are satisfied or by their nature expire. This includes, but is not limited to, the definitions, this Section 9.5, Sections 1, 2.7, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.4, 10, 11 and 12 of these Terms, and any other obligations that may reasonably be expected to be performed or observed after such termination or expiration.

**10\. INDEMNIFICATION.**

**10.1 Indemnification.**

Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Replicate and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns (each, a “**Replicate Indemnitee**”) from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Replicate Indemnitee resulting from Customer’s use of the Services, including in respect of any Action that relates to or arises out of or results from:

(a) Customer Data, including any Inputs, Outputs, and processing of Customer Data by a Model;

(b) Customer or its Authorized Users’ breach of Third Party Terms;

(c) any other materials or information (including any documents, data, specifications, software, content, or technology) provided by or on behalf of Customer;

(d) allegation of facts that, if true, would constitute Customer's breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations under these Terms;

(e) negligence, or more culpable act or omission (including recklessness or willful misconduct) by Customer, any Authorized User, or any third party on behalf of Customer, in connection with these Terms.

**10.2 Indemnification Procedure.**

Customer shall promptly assume control of the defense of applicable Actions, and shall employ counsel of its choice to handle and defend the same, at Customer’s sole cost and expense. Replicate may participate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense with counsel of its own choosing. Customer shall not settle any Action on any terms or in any manner that adversely affects the rights of a Replicate Indemnitee without such Party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If Customer fails or refuses to assume control of the defense of such Action, Replicate Indemnitees shall have the right, but no obligation, to defend against such Action, including settling such Action after giving notice to Customer, in each case in such manner and on such terms as the Replicate Indemnitees may deem appropriate. The Replicate Indemnitee’s failure to perform any obligations under this Section 10.2 will not relieve Customer of its obligations under this Section 10, except to the extent that the Customer can demonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

**10.3 Mitigation.**

If any of the Services are, or in Replicate’s opinion are likely to be, claimed to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third-party Intellectual Property Right, or if Customer's use of the Services is enjoined or threatened to be enjoined, Customer’s sole remedy is to terminate its Account and cease any use of the Services.

**11\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.**

**11.1 Exclusion of Damages.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT OF LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL REPLICATE OR ANY OF ITS LICENSORSBE LIABLE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, AND OTHERWISE, FOR ANY: (a) LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS, REVENUE, OR PROFIT OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE; (b) IMPAIRMENT, INABILITY TO USE OR LOSS, INTERRUPTION, OR DELAY OF THE SERVICES, OTHER THAN FOR THE ISSUANCE OF ANY APPLICABLE SERVICE CREDITS; (c) LOSS, DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, OR RECOVERY OF DATA, OR BREACH OF DATA OR SYSTEM SECURITY; (d) COST OF REPLACEMENT SERVICES; (e) LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION; OR (f) CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, ENHANCED, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PERSONS WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES OR SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY AGREED OR OTHER REMEDY OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

**11.2 Cap on Monetary Liability.**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT OF LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL REPLICATE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, WHETHER ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, EXCEED THE LOWER OF THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO REPLICATE UNDER THESE TERMS BY CUSTOMER IN THE 6 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR US$100. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

**11.3 Exceptions.**

(a) LAWS OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT US TO LIMIT CERTAIN DAMAGES AS SET OUT ABOVE IN THIS SECTION 11. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

(b) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE SET OUT HEREIN THESE TERMS DO NOT ENTITLE YOU TO A REMEDY FROM OUR LICENSORS. UNLESS YOU ENTER INTO DIRECT AGREEMENT WITH THEM, THEY ARE NOT LIABLE TO YOU DIRECTLY FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES.

**12\. GENERAL.**

**12.1 Entire Agreement and Conflicts.**

These Terms, including the [Privacy Policy](https://replicate.com/privacy), [Community Guidelines](https://replicate.com/community-guidelines), [Acceptable Use Policy](https://replicate.com/acceptable-use-policy), and the [Additional Terms](https://replicate.com/terms#additional-terms), constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between the Parties concerning the use of the Services and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral, concerning the subject matter of these Terms.

**12.2 Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.**

(a) **Governing Law**. These Terms shall be governed by the Laws of the State of California, exclusive of its choice of law rules. The Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any Law which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to these Terms. This paragraph will be interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits.

(b) **Forum Acceptance**. Any action arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be heard in the federal, state, or local courts in San Francisco, California and each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts. If you are using the Services and are not in the United States, you agree that the location for dispute resolution is acceptable to you and that you will not challenge the forum as being inconvenient for you.

**12.3 Arbitration; Exceptions.**

(a) **Arbitration**. Except for any controversy, allegation, or claim that arises out of or relates to our Intellectual Property Rights or requires us to seek an injunction against Customer (each of which may be sought by Replicate in any court of competent jurisdiction) to prevent any imminent harm against Replicate or its users or licensors, you and Replicate agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Services, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof, shall be settled by binding arbitration subject to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (“**FAA**”), federal arbitration law and in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA Rules**”). The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879. The sole arbitrator’s decision is final, except for a limited review by courts under the FAA, and can be enforced like any other court order or judgment.

(b) **Commencing Arbitration**. Before initiating arbitration, a Party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other Party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other Party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**Notice of Arbitration**”). Replicate’s address for Notice of Arbitration is: Replicate, Inc., 2261 Market Street #4056, San Francisco, CA 94114. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the Party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). The Parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the Parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Replicate may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Replicate will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if Replicate has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other Party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.

(c) **Arbitration Relief**. Except as provided in Section 12.3(d), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Replicate before an arbitrator was selected, Replicate will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator’s award includes an award of injunctive relief against a Party, in which case that Party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator’s application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

(d) **Individual Arbitration; No Class Action**. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, no arbitration or claim under these Terms shall be joined to any other arbitration or claim, including any arbitration or claim involving any other current or former user of our Services, and no class arbitration proceedings shall be permitted. YOU AND REPLICATE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Replicate agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND REPLICATE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

(e) **Arbitrator Authority**. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including any contention that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.

(f) **Severability**. If any provision of this arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced. If the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 12.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

(g) **Execution**. This arbitration and no class action clause shall be effective upon acceptance by Customer of these Terms and shall survive the termination or expiration of these Terms.

**12.4 Amendments to Terms.**

Replicate may amend these Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on the Website. The modifications will become effective as of the first day of the calendar month following the month in which they were first posted. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.

**12.5 Waiver, Severability, Headings.**

Replicate’s waiver of any default or breach of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach. In the event any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The headings in these Terms are for the convenience of reference only and have no legal effect.

**12.6 Notices.**

Customers may send us any material notice via email to [legal@replicate.com](mailto:legal@replicate.com).

**12.7 California Residents.**

If you reside in California, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by mail at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by calling them at (800) 952-5210.

**12.8 Compliance with Laws and Export Regulations.**

(a) Customer agrees to comply with all Laws with respect to its activities hereunder, and agrees not to export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Services or any other information or materials provided by us to any country where such export is restricted or requires an export license or governmental approval, without first obtaining the necessary permissions.

(b) By using the Services, **CUSTOMER CONFIRMS AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE NOT LOCATED IN SUCH A COUNTRY OR LISTED ON ANY SUCH PROHIBITED LIST**. You are responsible for complying with all applicable U.S. export laws and regulations at your own expense.

**12.9 Relationship Between the Parties.**

Nothing in these Terms will be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between the Parties. Neither Party will have the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the other’s behalf without such other Parties’ prior written consent.

**12.10 Assignment.**

Replicate may assign these Terms and any rights and obligations hereunder but Customer may not assign or transfer these Terms in whole or in part without Replicate’s prior written consent.

**12.11 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.**

These Terms apply only to Replicate and Customer and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and do not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the Parties to these Terms.

**12.12 Interpretation.**

For purposes of these Terms: (a) the words “include,” “includes,” and “including” are deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”; (b) the word “or” is not exclusive; (c) the words “herein,” “hereof,” “hereby,” “hereto,” and “hereunder” refer to these Terms as a whole; (d) words denoting the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice-versa; and (e) words denoting any gender include all genders.
