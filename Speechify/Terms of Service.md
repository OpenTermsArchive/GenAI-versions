**13.9 ENTIRE AGREEMENT**

These Terms and any document expressly referred to in them constitute the whole agreement between us and supersede all previous discussions, correspondence, negotiations, previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between us relating to their subject matter. We each acknowledge that neither of us relies on, or will have any remedies in respect of, any representation or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these Terms or the documents referred to in them. Each of us agrees that our only liability in respect of those representations and warranties that are set out in this agreement (whether made innocently or negligently) will be for breach of contract. Nothing in this section limits or excludes any liability for fraud.

**13.10 THIRD PARTY RIGHTS**

A person who is not party to these Terms will not, subject to section 12 (DMCA), have any rights under or in connection with these Terms.

**13.11 OUR LIABILITY**

(a) We will use reasonable endeavors to remedy faults in the Services. If we fail to comply with these Terms, we will be liable to you only for the purchase price of the Services in question. In addition, we will not be liable for:

    (i) Faulty operation of computers during the registration process or during completion of a subscription or during the transmission of any data and/or for incorrect or overly slow transmission of data by the internet provider and/or any damage that occurs due to information submitted by you not being received by us or not being received promptly or not being considered, as a consequence of technical faults with our software or hardware (whether or not they are within or outside of our control).

    (ii) Any loss or damage due to viruses or other malicious software that may infect your Device, computer equipment, software, data or other property caused by you accessing, using or downloading from the Services, or from transmissions via emails or attachments received from us.

    (iii) Any use of websites linked to the Services but operated by third parties.

(b) To the extent permitted by law, Speechify and its affiliates, suppliers, clients, or licensors (collectively, the “Protected Entities”) shall not be liable for any consequential, exemplary or punitive damages arising from, or directly or indirectly related to, the use of, or the inability to use, the Services or the content, materials and functions related thereto, your provision of information via the Services, or lost business or lost sales, or any errors, viruses or bugs contained in the Services, even if such Protected Entity has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall the Protected Entities be liable for or in connection with any content posted, transmitted, exchanged or received by or on behalf of any user or other person on or through the Products. In no event shall the total aggregate liability of the Protected Entities to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract or tort, including, but not limited to, negligence or otherwise) arising from these terms of use or your use of the Services exceed, in the aggregate, the amount, if any, paid by you to Speechify for your use of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, Speechify expressly disclaims any liability for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, business interruptions, or loss of data, whether in an action in contract, tort or otherwise, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

**13.12 PRE-LITIGATION PROCEDURE**

To ensure efficient and equitable resolution of disputes between you (the user) and Speechify, both parties agree to abide by a mandatory Pre-Litigation Conflict Resolution Framework. This process is designed to address concerns promptly and fairly, minimizing the need for arbitration and fostering a constructive relationship. This framework seeks to balance the need for a thorough, good-faith attempt at resolution with the practicalities of managing dispute processes efficiently and securely. It emphasizes genuine engagement with the process, manages exceptions responsibly, and aims to deter frivolous claims by setting clear, structured criteria for progression through the dispute resolution stages. 

**Step 1: Initial Informal Resolution**

Before initiating any formal dispute process, the Claimant is required to engage informally to seek an informal resolution. This engagement should be a genuine effort over 14 business days to resolve the issue informally before proceeding to the next steps. If Speechify is the defendant, your informal engagement should be with our customer support available at [\[email protected\]](https://speechify.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**Cool-Off Period**

Following the initial informal resolution period, a mandatory cool-off period of 14 business days is required. This period is intended to encourage both parties to resolve their differences before an official Notice of Dispute, and provides additional time to reflect on the issues in order to consider potential alternative solutions outside of formal dispute mechanisms.

**Step 2: Notice of Dispute**

If the dispute is not resolved informally, the Claimant shall prepare a Notice of Dispute. Speechify is committed to the security and confidentiality of the dispute resolution process, especially personally identifiable information and settlement privilege communication for both parties. All personal user data and personal employee data, including video submissions, shall be handled in strict compliance with applicable data protection laws and use end-to-end encryption. Speechify has provided a public encryption key in our data privacy guide for encrypting relevant files available at https://speechify.com/encryption-guide/, to go on a USB drive and mailed with a printed letter of identification for the Claimant. If you do not know how to use encryption, you may follow the easy instructions provided in our guide or contact our support.

A Notice of Dispute must include:

* A video statement recording explaining the dispute, your identity, and the desired outcome.
    * State your name and address, describe the dispute, and the the resolution or outcome you are seeking from Speechify or that we are seeking from you.
    * The video should be between two and five minutes to ensure conciseness.
    * Two to five minutes in a quiet, well-lit room using a simple digital camera or your smartphone, for convenience.
    * If a party is represented by counsel, they shall seek their counsel’s advice and coaching for the video statement.
* Any supporting documentation of incidents, receipts, dates relevant to your claim, etc.
* A printed, dated letter to the defendant, notarized in-person by the Claimant with a photocopy of legal identification. If the Claimant is not an individual, then a copy of their Articles of Incorporation shall suffice. This is needed to verify the authenticity of the claim and the validity of the Claimant’s identity. Claimant shall sign the cover letter with wet ink and provide a current physical address, email address, and phone number. If the Claimant is a Speechify user, you must provide your Speechify log-in info (username and IP address, as displayed in your account settings and in a site like whatismyipaddress.com respectively). Neither party shall share the personal information of the other except for with legal counsel. Each party will retain personal information only as long as needed to resolve the legal dispute.
* **(Optional) Public Key:** The Claimant may provide a copy of their public key and public key of their counsel (if available) on the USB drive, to be able to receive secure communication in response. The notarized note ensures no communication is subject to man-of-the-middle attacks as the keys are provided with identity verification.

**Step 3: Sending the Notice of Dispute**

The USB drive and notarized identification documents must be delivered by a process server or equivalent legal service professional who can provide formal acknowledgment of receipt. Upon completion of the delivery, the sender must immediately email confirmation of the service, including the date and time of delivery and the name of the person who acknowledged receipt. When sending a Notice of Dispute to Speechify, address the notice to Ofek Weitzman, CEO of Speechify. If we are the Claimant and do not have a legal name on file for you, we may send the information digitally to your email address on file, with a digital scan of the notarized dispute notice. 

**Step 4: Settlement Conference**

Upon receipt of Notice of Dispute, a mandatory settlement conference will be scheduled. This conference will take place in-person in Miami-Dade County, Florida. If a party is represented by counsel, counsel may also participate, but the Claimant (or the Claimant’s employee if a business) must be personally present. We believe that a face-to-face meeting is most conducive to resolving disputes amicably. Should exceptional circumstances prevent in-person attendance, accommodations for virtual participation may be assessed on a case-by-case basis; please provide proof of disability if you have one.

**Financial Hardship Considerations:** – Participants claiming financial travel hardship may provide evidence of their financial status and their legal name, date of birth, and home address for travel booking. Speechify will consider subsidizing travel costs for eligible participants. This may include booking air or bus travel to Miami-Dade. You accept that applying for subsidy may delay the agreed settlement conference date in order to enable Speechify to secure cost-effective travel arrangements for you with an advanced enough purchase of tickets by air, train, or bus. Speechify will book travel directly on your behalf for a day trip to the conference. Speechify may consider offering you temporary one-night housing at its sole discretion and on a case-by-case basis. Travel accommodation is not guaranteed.

If these considerations are not sufficient for you, you may consider applying for our expedited dispute route or you may seek a ruling from a judge for a virtual settlement conference; however, be mindful that pursuant to our Arbitration Agreement any ruling by a non-arbitrator will only be on the enforceability of these Terms and not on the substance of your claim subject to certain exceptions such as our right to pursue claims of intellectual property infringement in court.

**Step 5: Mediation**

If the dispute remains unresolved 14 days after the settlement conference, both parties agree to participate in mediation. We believe that face-to-face mediation is most conducive to resolving disputes amicably, and the mediation will be scheduled with you in Miami-Dade county, following similar considerations for extenuating circumstances as the Settlement Conference. If a party is represented by counsel, counsel may also participate. You and Speechify will mutually select a qualified mediator based in Miami-Dade County to facilitate this process.

**Moving to Litigation**

If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, the parties will proceed to initiate formal litigation proceedings, as outlined in our Arbitration Agreement.

**Exceptions to Pre-Litigation**

Exceptions to Pre-Litigation are outlined in Section 13.13 Expedited Dispute Resolution for Urgent Bona Fide User Claims. Additionally, this section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the claims seeking any relief or remedy measures against unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of Speechify’s intellectual property, AI models, trademarks, patents, or copyright.

Speechify is committed to resolving disputes fairly and efficiently. We believe that most disputes can be resolved through open dialogue and mutual understanding. This Pre-Arbitration Conflict Resolution Framework is designed to facilitate this goal, ensuring that all parties have the opportunity to express their views and seek resolution in a structured and respectful environment.

**13.13 EXPEDITED DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR URGENT BONA FIDE CLAIMS**

To ensure our dispute resolution process is both fair and efficient, we recognize the need to accommodate legitimate concerns that merit expedited attention. This section outlines our criteria and process for considering requests to modify or bypass certain pre-arbitration requirements for claims deemed bona fide and/or urgent based on objective and reasonable criteria.

**Criteria for Bona Fide Claims**

A claim may be considered bona fide and eligible for expedited or modified processing if it meets any of the following criteria:

1. **Immediacy and Harm**: The claim involves an issue where delay could result in irreparable harm or significant ongoing inconvenience to the Claimant.
2. **Financial Impact**: The claim pertains to a financial transaction involving the Claimant that involves a significant amount of money relative to the typical transactions made on our platform.
3. **Substantial Hardship**: The user demonstrates that following the standard process would cause substantial hardship due to extraordinary circumstances such as severe health issues or geographic limitations.

**Request Process**

Users may request expedited or modified dispute resolution by submitting a written request that includes:

* A clear explanation of the claim.
* Specific reasons why the claim meets one or more of the bona fide criteria listed above.
* Any supporting documentation or evidence that substantiates the user’s claims and the necessity for an expedited process.

**Review and Decision**

* Requests for expedited processing will be reviewed by a dedicated team within 5 business days of submission.
* Decisions will be communicated clearly to the user with an explanation of the reasons for the decision.
* If a request is approved, the dispute will be fast-tracked according to modified procedures that may include remote mediation or a simplified review process.

**Transparency and Fairness**

* All users, regardless of their account type (paid or free) or the duration of their use of our platform, are entitled to request consideration under this framework.
* We commit to treating each request with fairness and integrity, assessing each based on the merits of the information provided without bias.

**Continuous Improvement**

* We will regularly review the outcomes and feedback from the expedited dispute resolution process to ensure it meets our standards of fairness and effectiveness.
* Adjustments will be made as necessary to improve the process and address any emerging needs or challenges.

**13.14 ARBITRATION**

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY, AS THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH SPEECHIFY, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM SPEECHIFY.

(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Products that cannot be resolved by Pre-Litigation or in small claims court will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Speechify are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.

(b) Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator, who shall have at least five years of experience in computer software law and be selected from a panel provided by the American Arbitration Association. If the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address. In the case of an in-person hearing, the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by the arbitration institution. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA Rules with the remainder paid by Speechify. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Speechify for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

(c) Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Speechify. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Speechify.

(d) Jury Trial Waiver. You and Speechify waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. Rather, you and Speechify elect to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. In any litigation between you and Speechify over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and Speechify waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.

(e) Class Action Waiver. WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND SPEECHIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Speechify are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in section 13.13 below.

(f) Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Speechify may bring an individual action in small claims court.

(g) Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Speechify.

**13.15 EXCLUSIVE VENUE**

To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Speechify agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of Florida.

**13.16 CHOICE OF LAW**

Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of Florida, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter, including tort claims.

**13.17 SEVERABILITY**

If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be modified to reflect the parties’ intention or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the remainder of the Terms will continue in full force and effect and be enforceable.  In no event shall any such modification or elimination affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision or sub-subsection.

These Terms are effective and were last updated on June 10, 2024.
