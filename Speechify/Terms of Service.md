1. **GENERAL INFORMATION**

**1.1 SPEECHIFY SERVICES**

These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) contain the general terms and conditions on which Speechify, Inc. (“Speechify”, “us”, “our” or “we”) supply, and under which you may use, the content, products and/or services available via the [www.speechify.com](https://www.speechify.com/) website (the “Website”), through applications we distribute for use on mobile devices (the “Apps”) or via other delivery methods to you (the Website and such content, products, services are collectively referred to herein as the “Service” or “Services”, which may be updated from time-to-time at the sole discretion of Speechify). Please read these terms and conditions, carefully before accessing or ordering any Services from the Website or downloading any Apps from any third party App stores (e.g. the Apple App Store, the Android Play Store etc.). By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, including the provisions regarding arbitration, class action waiver, disclaimers, and limitations of liability. You further acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by our Privacy Policy ([https://speechify.com/privacy](https://speechify.com/privacy/)) and all other supplementary terms or Speechify policies incorporated herein by reference. In these terms, the term “Device” refers to the device which is used to access and use the Services and/or Apps including but not limited to computers, smart phones, computers, and tablets; and the term “you” refers to the user of the Services. When you order (“Order”) any Services, download any Apps or otherwise use or access the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. You may also be asked to click “I accept” at the appropriate place prior to your purchase, access to, or use of the Services. At such time, if you do not click “I accept”, you may not be able to complete such purchase or gain such access. By using the Services or Apps, you indicate that you accept these Terms and that you agree to abide by them. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must refrain from using the Services and/or Apps. 

You must be 18 years of age, or the age of majority in your province, territory or country, to use the Services or Apps. Individuals under the age of 18, or the applicable age of majority (each, a “Minor”), may utilize the Services and Apps only with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian, under such person’s account and otherwise subject to these Terms. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a Minor, you agree to bind the Minor to these Terms and to fully indemnify and hold us harmless if the Minor breaches any of these Terms.

Our contact email address is [help@speechify.com](mailto:help@speechify.com). All correspondence to Speechify including any queries you may have regarding your use of the Services or these Terms should be sent to this contact email address.

**1.2 ORDERS** 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions contained in these Terms, you may order certain Services by entering into one or more Orders.  Orders may be entered into by you via the Services interface, or by written agreement or order form executed by you and an authorized representative of Speechify. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, subscriptions are for designated users only and cannot be shared or used by more than one user.  You agree that your purchases hereunder are neither contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features nor dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Speechify regarding any future functionality or features.  If there is any inconsistency between an Order and these Terms, the Order controls.

(b) These Terms and the Order set out the whole agreement between you and us for the supply of the Services. In order to participate in certain Services, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions; those additional terms are hereby incorporated into these Terms. Where such terms are inconsistent with these Terms, the additional terms shall control.

(c) Please check that the details in these Terms and on the Order are complete and accurate before you use or commit yourself to purchase the Services. If you think that there is a mistake, please make sure that you ask us to confirm any changes in writing.

**1.3 CHANGES TO TERMS**

We may modify these Terms at any time. When that happens, we will post the revised version on this page and update the “Last Updated” date. If a change is material—meaning it significantly affects your rights or obligations—we will also use a method reasonably calculated to reach you, such as an e-mail to the address in your account profile, an in-product banner, pop-up, push notification, or any other method allowed by law. Where applicable law requires advance notice (for example, certain auto-renewal or price-increase rules), we will provide at least the legally required notice period; otherwise, the revised Terms take effect upon posting. Your continued use of the Services or Apps after the effective date constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the Services before they become effective and, if you have a paid subscription, you may cancel it through your account settings. You are responsible for keeping your contact information current so we can deliver any required notice.

1. **MEMBERSHIPS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS**

This User Information may include information from your Facebook and similar social networking profiles.

(iii) You will maintain the accuracy of such information; and

(iv) Your use of the Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation.

**2.2 MEMBERSHIP**

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, password and other User Information and for restricting access to your Device to further help protect such information. You are responsible for updating your User Information.

As a Speechify Member you will receive access to certain sections, features and functions of the Services that are not available to non-members. Your choices about receiving promotional e-mails, text or WhatsApp messages from Speechify are explained in, and governed by, our Messaging Consent Notice at [https://speechify.com/message-consent-notice](https://speechify.com/message-consent-notice/). You may withdraw any such consent at any time as described in that notice. Speechify memberships and subscriptions are not transferable and therefore cannot be sold or exchanged or transferred in any way whatsoever without Speechify’s express written consent.

**2.3 SUBSCRIPTIONS**

(a) Speechify Members may access the Services in three ways:

(i)  “Free Tier” means a limited version of the Services free of charge. This version may include feature limitations, usage caps, and platform restrictions. Access to the Free Tier is provided at our sole discretion, is not guaranteed, and may be modified or terminated at any time without notice.

(ii) “Paid Subscription”: a subscription fee-based program, which gives access additional features including and beyond the Free Tier, as further described on the Website. You can become a subscriber by purchasing a subscription (depending on which options you choose, those fees may recur each month or year thereafter, at the then-current rate) to the Services from the Website, within the Apps, where allowed by the App marketplace partners, or through a bundle with one or more of our bundle subscription partners. Please note that if you purchase a subscription through the Apple App Store or our iPhone application, the sale is final, and we will not provide a refund. Your purchase will be subject to Apple’s applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds. If you purchase a subscription through the Google Play store, the sale is final and we will not provide a refund. Your purchase will be subject to Google’s applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds. If you purchase through one or more of our bundle subscription partners, the purchase may be further subject to the terms and conditions of such partners, and payment and management of the bundle subscription may be administered by them.

(iii) “Free Trial” means a promotional, time-limited, no-charge subscription offer (currently three (3) days unless a different period is stated at sign-up) that gives you access to additional features including and beyond the “Free Tier.” The features available during any Free Trial may differ from those included in a Paid Subscription. Without limiting the foregoing, we reserve the right to exclude certain paid features from the Free Trial and, conversely, to include and test features not otherwise available in a Paid Subscription during the Free Trial, at our sole discretion. We may modify, limit, or expand Free Trial access at any time without notice. Unless you cancel before the trial ends, the Free Trial automatically converts to a paid Subscription Plan at the then-current price and renews on the same billing cycle until cancelled. We will charge the payment method you provided at sign-up when the Free Trial converts.   

(iv) “Group Subscriptions” refer to any subscription plan intended for multiple users under a single billing or administrative arrangement, including Corporate Subscriptions and Community Subscriptions. A “Corporate Subscription “means a subscription purchased by or on behalf of a for-profit business, company, or other commercial entity, typically for use by its employees or contractors. A “Community Subscription” means a subscription offered to or administered by an educational institution, nonprofit organization, religious group, online community, student group, or similar non-commercial entity. Regardless of how access to the Services is obtained — including through a Group Subscription — these Terms apply to each individual end user. By using the Services, each user agrees to be bound by these Terms, whether or not they are the direct purchaser or subscriber. Group administrators are responsible for ensuring that all authorized users comply with these Terms.

(b) Any promotion code or offer provided by us may not be used in conjunction with any other promotion code or offer, past or present. Introductory offers are only available to new users of the Services, except where expressly stated otherwise. Previous users or trial users of the Services do not qualify as new users. No promotion code or discount will apply to Group Subscriptions. Unless otherwise set forth in the terms of any promotion, all pricing promotions or discounts will apply to the initial period of the subscription, and any renewals will be charged at the rate in effect at the time of renewal for the type of subscription purchased.

(c) Our subscriptions are paid for by an upfront one-off payment with automatic monthly or annual renewal (depending on the option you choose when you first subscribed). You acknowledge and agree that Speechify is authorized to charge your payment method for (i) the initial subscription fee at the rate disclosed at the time of purchase, and (ii) any applicable renewal subscription fee(s) at the then-current rate in effect at the time of such renewal.

(d) **IMPORTANT NOTICE-AUTOMATIC RENEWAL**: SUBSCRIPTION TERMS WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR ADDITIONAL PERIODS EQUAL TO THE EXPIRING SUBSCRIPTION TERM UNLESS YOU CANCEL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CANCELLATION TERMS BELOW. UPON SUCH RENEWAL, SPEECHIFY OR OUR THIRD PARTY PAYMENT PARTNERS WILL CHARGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD WITH THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY TAXES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON YOUR PAYMENT. 

(e) For business and enterprise Group Subscriptions only: Either party may elect not to renew by delivering written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the then-current Subscription Term (“Notice Period”) unless otherwise specified in the mutually executed order. If no timely notice is received, the Group Subscription will automatically renew for an additional term of equal length at our then-current rates. Any cancellation delivered fewer than thirty (30) days before the renewal date will become effective at the end of the next-following term.

(f) **CANCELLING AS A CONSUMER**: YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME BY INITIATING A CANCELLATION THROUGH YOUR SPEECHIFY ACCOUNT SETTINGS, APPLE ACCOUNT SETTINGS, OR GOOGLE ACCOUNT SETTINGS, WHICHEVER YOU FIRST USED TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE SERVICE. YOU MAY REQUEST ASSISTANCE IN CANCELLATING BY EMAILING OUR SUPPORT TEAM AT [HELP@SPEECHIFY.COM](mailto:HELP@SPEECHIFY.COM) AND PROVIDING YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND METHOD OF PURCHASE. PLEASE NOTE THAT SUBSCRIPTION FEES UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF YOUR THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM WILL NOT BE REFUNDED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW.  YOU WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PRO-RATED REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEES PAID FOR ANY UNUSED DAYS OF THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM.  INSTEAD, IF YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOU WILL ENJOY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BENEFITS UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM FOR WHICH YOU HAVE PAID, AND YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BENEFITS WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT REFUNDS, PLEASE SEE OUR REFUND POLICY ([https://speechify.com/refund-policy/](https://speechify.com/refund-policy/)).

Please note that if you purchase a subscription through the Apple App Store in-app-purchases, all subscription management and requests for cancellation and refunds and similar terms are entirely administered and agreed to between you and Apple, not Speechify. You may cancel automatic Apple renewals by selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your Apple Account settings and selecting the subscription you want to modify. Likewise, if you purchase a subscription through the Google Play store, the subscription is entirely managed by Google, not by Speechify, and you must cancel automatic renewals in your Google account settings under Subscriptions in the Google Play app, or according to the current process outlined by Google. If you purchase a subscription through a bundle subscription partner, you may cancel according to the process outlined by the bundle subscription partner. If you purchased your subscription directly from Speechify by entering billing information on our website (and not via Apple or Google), you may cancel at any time through your user account settings. To do so, click the “Cancel Subscription” button, which is clearly and prominently displayed under the “Subscription” heading in your account settings, accessible at [https://app.speechify.com/settings?tab=subscription](https://app.speechify.com/settings?tab=subscription).

(g) In compliance with California law and for your convenience, we provide the following information for you in the following cases:

* * Before you complete your purchase for a Paid Subscription or your Free Trial registration, the renewal price and terms will be presented to you in a clear and conspicuous manner for your review and consent. 
    * Upon completing your order, we send you a confirmation email containing the automatic renewal offer terms and instructions on how to cancel. Please retain this email for your records.
    * Annual Subscriptions: If you are on an annual subscription plan, we will send a reminder notice to your email address on file no less than 15 days and no more than 45 days before your subscription renews.
    * Promotional and Trial Offers: If you signed up for a free trial or promotional offer lasting more than 31 days, we will send a reminder notice to your email address on file no less than 3 days and no more than 21 days before the end of the promotional period.

All reminder notices will state the date of your renewal, the upcoming renewal price, and provide information on how to cancel your subscription to avoid future charges.

(h) You agree to promptly notify Speechify of any changes to your payment method you provided while any subscriptions remain outstanding. You are responsible for all applicable fees and charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all subscriptions purchased by you.

(i) In the course of your use of the Services, Speechify and its third party payment service provider may receive and implement updated credit card information from your credit card issuer in order to prevent your subscription from being interrupted by an outdated or invalid card. This disbursement of the updated credit card information is provided to Speechify and Speechify’s third party payment service provider at the sole election of your credit card issuer. Your credit card issuer may give you the right to opt-out of the update service. Should you desire to do so, please contact your credit card issuer.

(j) Our obligation to provide the Services only begins when we take receipt of your Order, and we confirm your purchase to you by email. We will confirm your Order and send you an email to confirm your access to the subscription purchased. Please quote the Order number in all subsequent correspondence with us. Prices in US Dollars and Euros include local taxes. All prices in Pound Sterling include VAT unless otherwise stated. You agree not to hold us responsible for banking charges incurred due to payments on your account. If payment is not received by us from the Payment Method you provided, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us. You are not permitted to resell any Services.

We will notify you at least 30 calendar days in advance of any such change. If you do not agree to the change, you must cancel your membership or subscription in your account settings or by emailing [help@speechify.com](mailto:help@speechify.com).

**13.12.2  Definitions**

* * **“Demand”** – a written notice satisfying Section 13.12.4.
    * **“Consumer User”** – an individual who subscribes to or uses the Services primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.
    * **“Business User”** – (i) any entity; (ii) any individual who registers under a Speechify Business, Enterprise, Studio, Voice-Over, or API plan or pays with a commercial payment instrument; or (iii) any individual who otherwise uses the Services primarily for commercial or professional purposes.

    * **“Small claims threshold”** means the maximum dollar amount permitted under the small claims procedure in your jurisdiction.

**13.12.3  Governing Law; FAA**

This Section evidences a transaction in interstate commerce; therefore, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, governs its interpretation and enforcement.  Where state law is relevant, the internal laws of the State of Florida (excluding conflict-of-law principles) apply.

**13.12.4  Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Procedure**

Before commencing arbitration or small-claims litigation, a Claimant must e-mail a **Demand** to the other Party:

* * **Demands to Speechify:** [legal@speechify.com](mailto:legal@speechify.com)
    * **Demands to You:** the e-mail and, if available, postal address in your account.

The Demand must: (i) identify the claimant; (ii) describe the dispute and the relief sought with reasonable detail; and (iii) be personally signed.  Within thirty (30) days of receipt, either Party may request a single, sixty-minute telephonic or video settlement conference.  No arbitration or lawsuit may be filed until the later of (a) thirty (30) days after the Demand is received, or (b) ten (10) days after the conference, if any.  All limitation periods are tolled during this window.

**13.12.5  Arbitration Forums, Rules, and Locations**

If the Dispute stated in the Demand is not resolved to your or our satisfaction within ten (10) business days after the conference described in Section 13.12.4 (or within ten (10) business days after the deadline to request such a conference if none is requested), and you or we intend to initiate legal action, you agree that any such action shall be filed solely as an individual arbitration, subject to the Mass Filing provisions in this Section. The arbitration shall be administered by the forum specified in the table below and conducted under the corresponding arbitration rules, as modified by this Agreement. All referenced rules are incorporated by reference and hyperlinked in the table below. For users located outside the United States, alternative forums and governing laws may apply, as set forth in Section 13.13 (International Dispute Resolution Provisions).

**13.12.6  Costs and Fee Allocation**

* * **Consumer Users:** Speechify pays all JAMS or NAM filing, administration, and arbitrator fees except the first **US $250** of the filing fee.  Hearing-day fees are split 50/50 up to US $5 000 each; Speechify pays any excess.
    * **Business Users:** All arbitration fees (filing, administration, arbitrator, and hearing) are split **50/50** unless the applicable rules mandate a different allocation.

**13.12.7  Arbitrator Authority and Relief**

The arbitrator shall decide all issues of arbitrability, jurisdiction, and the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Section.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief **only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to remedy the claimant’s individual claim.**

**13.12.8 CLASS ACTION WAIVER:**

**You and we agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.  Unless both you and we agree otherwise or the Mass Arbitration provisions set forth above are triggered, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.  Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s).  Any relief awarded cannot affect any other person or party.  You and we further agree that in the event this arbitration agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, the prohibitions on class and representative actions and non-individualized relief set forth in this paragraph are severable and shall apply to any claim between you and us in any forum.  YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS.  The arbitrator’s award shall be confidential, final, and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by JAMS’s rules or NAM’s rules, as applicable.**

**13.12.9  JURY TRIAL WAIVER:**

**IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE EACH UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.  THIS MEANS THAT ANY CLAIM WOULD BE DECIDED BY A JUDGE, NOT A JURY.**

**13.12.10  Application of Consumer Law to Business Users**

Speechify’s Business, Enterprise, Studio, Voice-Over, and API offerings are intended for commercial use.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, Business Users acknowledge and agree that consumer-protection statutes and implied warranties do not apply.  Where non-waivable consumer law (e.g., the Australian Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)) applies, Speechify’s liability is limited, at its option, to replacement, repair, or re-supply of the Services or a pro-rata refund of prepaid fees for the unused portion of the subscription.

**13.12.11  Excluded Disputes**

The following may proceed in court (Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA) or in small-claims court as appropriate: (i) intellectual-property claims seeking injunctive relief; (ii) individual claims properly filed in small-claims court; and (iii) requests for public injunctive relief where such relief is not arbitrable.

**13.12.12  Severability**

If any provision of this Section—other than the Class Action Waiver—is found unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the remainder enforced.  If the Class Action Waiver is found unenforceable, the entire Agreement to Arbitrate is void as to the affected claim(s), which shall then proceed exclusively in court subject to Section 13.12.14.

**13.12.13  Changes to this Arbitration Agreement**

If Speechify changes this Section 13.12 after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject that change by sending us written notice to our legal mail address referenced in this Terms of Service, along with an e-mail to [legal@speechify.com](mailto:legal@speechify.com), within thirty (30) days of the date the change becomes effective. Rejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Speechify (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and Speechify.

**13.12.14  Judicial Forum for Non-Arbitrable Claims**

If a claim is adjudicated not to be subject to arbitration, the exclusive forum shall be the state or federal courts located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA, and each Party irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

**13.12.15  Survival**

This Section 13.12 survives termination of the Agreement and cessation of use of the Services.

**13.13  International Dispute-Resolution Provisions**

The following regional provisions apply **in lieu of Section 13.12** for users who both reside and use the Services in the specified jurisdiction:

**13.13.1  Canada**
