What is a cookie?
-----------------

A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies are essential to the Site, Software, and/or Services, and will always be used. Web beacons, tags, and scripts may be used in the Site or in emails to help us deliver cookies and count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers (for example, Google Analytics) on an individual and aggregated basis.

Types of cookies Speechify uses
-------------------------------

Many jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users/visitors as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies.

Each cookie used by Speechify falls within one of the following categories:

**Essential cookies**

Essential cookies (First-Party Cookies) are sometimes called “strictly necessary,” as without them we cannot provide many services that you need. For example, essential cookies help remember your preferences as you use our Site, Software, and/or Services.

**Analytics cookies**

These cookies track information about your visits and usage of the Site, Software, and/or Services so that we can make improvements and report our performance — for example, to analyze visitor and user behavior so as to provide more relevant content or suggest certain activities. We might also use analytics cookies to test new ads, pages, or features to see how users react to them. Google Analytics is the main technology we currently use in this regard. To learn more about Google Analytics and your privacy, visit the “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” page at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics when using our website, visit [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**Functionality or preference cookies**

During your visit to the Site, or while you use our Software or Services, cookies are used to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region). They also store your preferences when personalizing the Site, Software, and/or Services to optimize your use of Speechify (for example, your preferred language). These preferences are remembered through the use of persistent cookies, and the next time you visit the Site or use our Software and/or Services, you will not have to set them again.

**Cookies for promoting Speechify paid accounts**

These Third-Party Cookies are placed by third-party advertising platforms or networks in order to deliver ads for Speechify paid accounts and track the performance of those ads. These platforms may subsequently use information about your visit to Speechify.com to target you with advertising for Speechify paid accounts on other websites. You can opt out of interest-based targeting provided by participating ad servers through the Digital Advertising Alliance ([http://youradchoices.com](http://youradchoices.com/)).

**Social media cookies**

The Site includes third-party social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and third-party widgets, such as the ‘Share This’ button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Site. These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Site, as well as set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interaction with these features is governed by the privacy policy of the third-party company providing it. Here are some examples of third-party social media features that we use, and their privacy policies:
