We use cookies for analytics purposes, to deliver certain features of the Site or Services, to help us understand how users engage with the Site or Services, and to improve your experience. You may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and to accept or refuse certain cookies. However, if you elect not to accept cookies, some functionality and areas of the Site or Services may be restricted. To learn how to manage your cookies, please follow the instructions from your specific browser, or if accessing the Site or Services via a mobile device, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions.

[​](#online-analytics-and-advertising)

Online Analytics And Advertising
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Analytics.**  
    We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics) on our Site or Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by [clicking here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.
2. **Online Advertising.**  
    In using the Site or Services, we may allow select third-party advertising technology partners to place cookies or other tracking technologies on the browser of your device to collect information about you as discussed above. These third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Twitter Ads, Bing Ads, and others) may use this information to serve relevant content and advertising to you as you browse the Internet, and access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your browser to assist in this activity. If you are interested in more information about these online advertising activities, and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/), the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link](http://optout.aboutads.info/), or [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. Please note that if you use these mechanisms, you may still see advertising on our Site or Services or across the Internet, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.
3. **Do Not Track (“DNT”).**  
    DNT is a privacy preference that web users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Services through cookies and similar technologies, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.
