**FAL PRIVACY POLICY**

**Last Updated:** **April 20****th****, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how fal - Features & Labels Inc. ("**fal**," "**we**," or "**us**") collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes information about you when you access or use our website, [https://fal.ai/](https://fal.ai/) and other online products and services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, our "**Services**") and when you otherwise interact with us such as through our customer support channels.

fal's primary business offering is an AI-powered generative media platform for developers to integrate into their applications, though we also offer a version of our platform directly to individuals through our Services. If you are an enterprise user of the Services, and your use is governed by an enterprise contract, we handle your personal information as a service provider (sometimes called a "processor") on behalf of the enterprise customer. Personal information processed on behalf of our enterprise customers is therefore not subject to this Privacy Policy. If you are an enterprise user of our Services, please contact the enterprise customer who has provided you with access to our Services.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy. If we make material changes, we will provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to the Services or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.
