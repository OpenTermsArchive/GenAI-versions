**xAI Privacy Policy**
======================

_Effective: January 2, 2024 ([previous version](https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy/previous-2024-12-20))_

At x.AI, L.L.C. ("**xAI**", "**our**", "**us**" or "**we**"), we value your privacy and are committed to being fair, accountable, and transparent in how we handle your personal information. Our Privacy Policy outlines how we collect and use your personal information when you use our websites, applications, and other xAI services (our "**Service**"). It also describes your privacy rights.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to data that we process on behalf of customers of our business offerings, such as our API. Our use of that data is governed by customer agreements covering access to and use of those business offerings. This Privacy Policy also does not apply if you access our Service through a third-party’s service. In that case, the third-party’s privacy policy would apply, and you would contact that third-party regarding the processing of your personal information. For example, your use of X (previously Twitter), including use of Grok on X, is governed by the [X Privacy Policy](https://x.com/en/privacy) and [X Terms](https://x.com/en/tos), not this xAI Privacy Policy.

**1\. About xAI and Grok**
--------------------------

xAI is a US-based company working on building artificial intelligence tools to accelerate human scientific discovery. We are guided by our mission to advance our collective understanding of the universe. As part of our mission, we have developed “Grok,” a conversational generative AI powered by xAI’s large language models. More information about xAI’s development and training of Grok, is available on the [xAI website](https://x.ai/about). xAI is a separate company from X Corp ("**X**", previously Twitter).

**2\. Personal information we collect**
---------------------------------------

### **2.1 Personal information you provide:**

When you use our Service or communicate with us, you provide certain personal information, including:

* _Account Data:_ When you create an account with us, we will collect information associated with your account, including your name, contact information, account credentials, date of birth, and Payment Data. If you log into our Service using a third-party service, that third-party will send your information to us at your direction. For example, if you use your existing X credentials to log into an xAI mobile app or website, you may choose to direct X to share the following information with us: your X public profile, X username; numeric X ID; whether you are subscribed to X Premium, and your Grok on X conversation history.
* _Payment Data_: Where payment is required to access the Service, we may collect payment information (such as payment card information) directly from you and details regarding your transactions with us.
* _Communication Data:_ If you communicate with us, such as by email, by our webpages, or on social media sites, we may collect personal information including your name, email address, any other contact details you voluntarily choose to provide us, and the contents of messages you send.
* _User Content:_ We collect personal information that you provide to our Service, including your prompts and other content you upload, such as files, images, and other material (“Input”). Outputs of the Service (“Output”), including responses Grok generates, are based on your Input (together, "User Content"). If you include personal information in Inputs you provide to the Service, this information may be reproduced in the Output. Please do not share any personal information (including any sensitive information) in your Input to the Service.
* _Feedback Data:_ Where applicable, we will collect your Feedback (as defined in our Terms of Service). This might arise if, for example, in a given conversation with Grok, you rate an Output using the thumbs-up/thumbs-down icons.
* _Social Media Information_: We have pages on social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, Medium, X, YouTube and LinkedIn. When you interact with our social media pages, we collect personal information that you choose to provide to us, such as your contact details (collectively, “Social Data”). In addition, the companies that host our social media pages may provide us with aggregate information and analytics about our social media activity.
* _Applicant Data:_ If you apply for a job with xAI, we will collect your personal information such as your contact details, resume/CV, education and work history, visa status, and other information (including interview recordings and screenshots, where permissible). You also may choose to provide your gender, ethnicity, veteran status, disability status, and links to your website, blog, portfolio, LinkedIn or other public profiles. We may also receive personal information about you from our affiliated companies and third parties, such as recruitment agencies, social media platforms, and individuals who refer you.

With the exception of our recruitment activities, we do not aim to collect sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometric data, criminal background, or trade union membership) and ask that you do not provide us with any such information.

### **2.2 Personal information we collect automatically**

We automatically collect certain device and usage information when you use or interact with our Service (collectively, "Technical Usage Data"). This may include:

* _Device data:_ Technical information such as your IP address, device type, country from which you access, browser type and version, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system.

* _Location data_: We may determine the general area from which your device accesses our Services based on information like its IP address for security reasons and to make your product experience better. Also, you may choose to provide more precise location information, such as your device’s GPS location or from third-party services that you use.
* _Cookies_: We use cookies and similar technologies to operate and administer our Services, and improve your experience. If you use our Services without creating an account, we may store some of the information described in this Privacy Policy with cookies, for example to help maintain your preferences across browsing sessions. For details about our use of cookies, please read our [Cookie Policy](https://x.ai/legal/cookie-policy).

### **2.3 Personal information we receive from other sources**

For more information on the sources of information used to develop our large language models, see our [consumer FAQs](https://x.ai/legal/faq).
* _Public X posts and internet search data_: The Service uses public posts shared on X, engagement data such as number of followers, and number of views, likes, reposts, shares, and replies. In response to search queries, the Service may conduct real-time information that is publicly available on the internet. In some instances, this data may include personal information.
* _Third-party datasets_: The Service may use datasets from third-party businesses and partners, including from security partners to protect against fraud, abuse, and other security threats to our Services.

We may also aggregate or de-identify your personal information so that it no longer identifies you and use this information for the purposes described above, such as to analyze the way our Service is being used, to improve and add features to them, and to conduct research. We will maintain and use de-identified information in de-identified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information, unless required by law.

**4\. Sharing of your personal information**
--------------------------------------------

We may share your your personal information with others in the following circumstances:

* _With our contracted service providers:_ To assist in providing the Service to you or performing business operations, we provide your personal information to service providers including providers of hosting, cloud, web analytics, content delivery, support and safety monitoring, payment and transaction, and other technology services, for the purposes described above.
* _In connection with business transfers:_ In connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction, or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company. If required by applicable laws, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any transfer of personal information to an unaffiliated third party.
* _To comply with our_ _legal obligations:_ To (i) comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process, (ii) protect the rights and property of xAI and our agents, customers, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms of service, (iii) to protect against legal liability, or (iv) to protect the personal safety of xAI, its customers, or any person.

* _Other users and third-parties you interact with or share information with:_ Certain features may allow you to share information with third-parties, including through the X platform. Information you share on X is governed by X’s terms and policies. Any information you voluntarily share in communities, forums, blogs, or chat rooms on our Service or third-party websites may be read, collected, and used by others.

We may also create and share aggregated and de-identified usage data with our related companies and also with third parties to help us perform analysis and make improvements.

Except as detailed above, we do not share, sell, or rent any of your personal information to any third party. We will notify you if this changes.

**5\. Marketing**
-----------------

We do not collect and use your personal information for marketing purposes and do not share your personal information with third parties for the purpose of marketing.

**6\. Security of your personal information**
---------------------------------------------

xAI implements commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures designed to protect personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no security measure or method of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you provide to the Services. In addition, you are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices, and signing out of websites and accounts after your sessions.

**7\. Retention of your personal information**
----------------------------------------------

We retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. In certain circumstances, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons after our contractual relationship has ended. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement. For example, we may retain your personal information:

* when we have a legal obligation to do so (e.g., if we receive a court order, we would retain your information for longer than our usual retention periods);
* to deal with and resolve requests and complaints (e.g., if there is an ongoing complaint about you);
* to protect the safety, security, and integrity of our business and the Service, as well as to protect our rights and property and those of others (e.g., if we detect misuse of our Service or otherwise detect unusual activity on your account or in your interactions with us); and
* for litigation or regulatory matters (e.g., we would retain your information if there was an ongoing legal claim and the information was relevant to the claim).

The length of time we retain data may depend on the features or settings you use. For example, Grok Temporary Chats will not show in your conversation history but will be kept in xAI’s systems for up to 30 days for safety purposes.

To request your data be deleted, follow the instructions in our [FAQ -Consumer](https://x.ai/legal/faq).

**8\. Links to other websites and social media features**
---------------------------------------------------------

Our Service may contain links to websites or plugins of social media platforms that are not operated by us. Third-party websites have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies, and you should read these carefully before you submit any personal information to these websites.

**9\. Children's privacy**
--------------------------

As noted in the [Terms of Service](https://x.ai/terms-of-service), our Service is not directed at children or minors under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from them. While we have taken measures to limit undesirable training data and outputs, Grok could produce output that is not appropriate for all ages. Parents of teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 years old must agree to the Terms of Service and are urged to exercise care in monitoring the use of this Service by their teenagers. Depending on how a user interacts with the Service, the Service may have content such as some suggestive dialogue, coarse language, crude humor, sexual situations, or violence.

If you are a child under the age of 13, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use our Service. If we learn that we have inadvertently obtained personal information about a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information. Please contact us at [privacy@x.ai](mailto:privacy@x.ai) if you are aware that we may have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 13.

### **11.4 International transfers**

By using our Service, you understand and acknowledge that your personal information will be used, stored and/or accessed by us in the United States and disclosed to our service providers in other jurisdictions. We maintain primary data centers in the United States. We take steps designed to ensure that the personal information we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed as described in this Policy and according to applicable law.

When we provide any personal information about you to any non-UK and non-EEA third-party, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures may include the following:

* Ensuring that there is an adequacy decision by the UK Government in the case of transfers out of the UK, or by the European Commission in the case of transfers out of the EEA, which means that the recipient country is deemed to provide adequate protection for such personal information; or
* Having in place standard contractual clauses with the recipient which have been approved by the UK Government for transfers out of the UK or by European Commission for transfers outside the EEA.

Further details on the steps we take to protect your personal information, in these cases, are available upon request by contacting us by email at [privacy@x.ai](mailto:privacy@x.ai) at any time.

### **11.5 Your rights**

* You may **access, correct, update or request deletion** of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions.  
    Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Output from our models. If Output contains factually inaccurate personal information relating to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make every effort to correct this information — but due to the technical complexity of our models, it may not always be possible for us to do so.
    
* You can **object to processing** of your personal information when our processing is based on our legitimate interests, ask us to **restrict processing** of your personal information or **request portability** of your personal information, (i.e., your data to be transferred in a readable and standardized format).  
    Please note you can opt-out of our use of your information to train our models in your settings. See [FAQ - Consumer](https://x.ai/legal/faq).
    
* If we send you any marketing communications, you have the right to **opt-out of marketing communications** at any time. We may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your Grok access, legally required notices, or our ongoing business relations.
    
* If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can **withdraw your consent** at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
    
* You have the right to **complain to a supervisory authority** about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local supervisory authority. Contact details for supervisory authorities in the EEA and the UK are available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm). Certain supervisory authorities may require that you exhaust our own internal complaints process before looking into your complaint.
    

If you have an xAI account to access the Service, some of these rights may be exercised through your account. You can also exercise your rights by contacting us at [privacy@x.ai](mailto:privacy@x.ai).

Please note, however, that your personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, for example if we need to keep using your information to comply with our own legal obligations or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If an exception applies, we will inform you when responding to your request. We may request that you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.

### **12.2 Your rights**

In addition to the rights detailed above in Sections 10 and 11 (e.g., your right to access, correct, or update your personal information), depending on what U.S. privacy law applies to you and subject to certain exceptions, you may also have the following rights:

* The right to submit certain privacy requests through an Authorized Agent.
