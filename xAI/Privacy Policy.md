#### 1\. About xAI and Grok

xAI is a US-based company working on building artificial intelligence tools to accelerate human scientific discovery. We are guided by our mission to advance our collective understanding of the universe. xAI is a separate company from X Corp ("X", previously Twitter).

For example, we have developed “Grok,” a conversational generative AI powered by xAI’s large language models. Grok’s training journey, and more information about Grok, is available on the [xAI website](https://x.ai/about).

#### 2\. Collection of your personal information

2.1 Personal information you provide

When you use our Service, communicate with us, or apply for a job, you provide certain personal information. This may include:

* _Account Data:_  When an xAI account is required to access the Service, we will collect your name, contact information, account credentials, and, where payment is required, Payment Data (described below). If you register or log into our Service using another service, that service will send your information to us. For example, when you use your existing X credentials to access the Service on an xAI website, X shares the following information with us at your direction: Twitter/X handle/username; your publicly visible name on X; numeric Twitter ID; the URL to your profile picture; and whether you are subscribed to X Premium.
    
* _Payment Data:_ Where payment is required to access the Service, we may collect payment information (such as payment card information) directly from you and details regarding your transactions with us.
    
* _Contact and Communications Data:_ If you communicate with us, we will collect contact information such as your name, email address, any other contact details you voluntarily choose to provide us, and any additional information you provide in your communications with us.
    
* _Applicant Data:_ If you apply for a job or role with xAI, we will collect your personal information such as your contact details, resume/CV, education and work history, visa status, and other information obtained during interviews (including interview recordings and screenshots, where permissible). You also may choose to provide your gender, ethnicity, veteran status, disability status, and links to your website, blog, portfolio, LinkedIn or other public profiles.
    
* _Social Media Information_: We have pages on social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, Medium, X, YouTube and LinkedIn. When you interact with our social media pages, we collect personal information that you choose to provide to us, such as your contact details (collectively, “Social Data”). In addition, the companies that host our social media pages may provide us with aggregate information and analytics about our social media activity.
    

With the exception of our recruitment activities, we do not aim to collect sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometric data, criminal background, or trade union membership) and ask that you do not provide us with any such information.

2.2 Personal information we collect when you use Grok

When you use or interact with Grok, whether on X or on our Service, we collect certain information from or about you. This may include:

* _User Content:_ We collect personal information that is included in user prompts or inputs (like the text, photos, images, file uploads, and other materials you submit to Grok) ("Input") and the outputs generated by Grok (like the text responses that Grok generates based on your Input) ("Output") (together, "User Content"). If you include personal information in Inputs you provide to Grok, this information may be reproduced in the Output. Please do not share any personal information (including any sensitive information) in your Input to Grok.
    
* _Feedback Data:_ We may collect your suggestions, recommendations, or other feedback relating to Grok. This might arise if, for example, in a given conversation with Grok, you report that Grok returned inaccurate information in an Output or you rate an Output to your Input using the thumbs-up/thumbs-down icons. If you provide such feedback, we may collect it even if you have opted out of our use of your information to train our models.
    
* _Interaction Data_: We also receive certain information about your use of Grok, such as the frequency and duration of interactions, the number and length of sessions, response times, and how often you use Grok over time. This may also include other usage data, such information about the features you engage with, the sequence of actions, and types of tasks performed.
    

We use this information to provide Grok's functionality to you, to improve your user experience, and to further train and improve our models.

2.3 Personal information we collect automatically

We automatically collect certain device and usage information when you use or interact with our Service (collectively, "Technical Usage Data"). This may include:

* _Device data:_ Technical information such as your IP address, device type, country from which you access, browser type and version, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system.
    
* _Usage data_: Information about your use of the Service, pages you view, date and time of your visit, duration of visits, pages visited, browsing history, search history, traffic data, standard server log information, and other communication data.

We may collect this information through our Service or through other methods of web analysis, including with the help of technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, and clear gifs.

* _Public X Posts:_ We collect public posts shared on X, which includes the content of public posts, the date shared, and engagement data such as the number of followers associated with the account as well as the number of views, likes, reposts, shares, and replies.

* _For our business or commercial purposes_: We may use your personal information for other legitimate business purposes, such as to identify new customers, data analysis, developing new products, identifying usage trends, and operating and expanding our business activities.
    

We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy, where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.

#### 4\. Sharing of your personal information

We do not share your personal information with third parties, other than as follows:

* _With our contracted vendors, service providers and consultants:_ To assist in providing the Service to you or performing business operations, we provide your personal information to vendors and service providers including providers of hosting services, cloud services, web analytics providers, content delivery services, support and safety monitoring services, and payment and transaction providers and other technology service providers, for the purposes described above.
    
* _In connection with business transfers:_ In connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction, or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company. If required by applicable laws, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any transfer of personal information to an unaffiliated third party.
    
* _To comply with our_ _legal obligations:_ To (i) comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process, (ii) protect the rights and property of xAI and our agents, customers, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms of service, or (iii) in an emergency, to protect the personal safety of xAI, its customers, or any person.
    
* _With our related companies_: We may disclose personal information to our related companies to the extent such sharing is necessary to fulfill a request you have submitted via our Service or for customer management, customer support, technical operations, or the purposes described above.
    

We may also create and share anonymized, aggregated and de-identified usage data with our related companies and also with third parties to help us perform analysis and make improvements. Additionally, we may share anonymous usage data on an aggregate basis in the normal course of operating our business. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends in the use of our Service.

Save as expressly detailed above, we do not share, sell, or rent any of your personal information to any third party and will not do so without updating this Privacy Policy, notifying you, or, where necessary, obtaining your consent.

Please note that any personal information or other information you choose to submit in communities, forums, blogs, or chat rooms on our websites may be read, collected, and used by others who visit these forums or pages.

#### 5\. Marketing

We do not collect and use your personal information for marketing purposes and do not share your personal information with third parties for the purpose of marketing.

#### 6\. Security of your personal information

xAI takes reasonable precautions to safeguard your personal information, including through use of appropriate organizational and technical measures to help safeguard your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure. Although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and that any such transmission of your personal information to us is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access to it. You are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices, and signing out of websites and online accounts after your sessions.

#### 7\. Retention of your personal information

We retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (e.g., to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal requirements). In certain circumstances, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons after our contractual relationship has ended. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement.

For example, we may retain your personal information:

• when we have a legal obligation to do so (e.g., if we receive a court order, we would retain your information for longer than our usual retention periods);

• to deal with and resolve requests and complaints (e.g., if there is an ongoing complaint about you);

• to protect the safety, security, and integrity of our business and the Service, as well as to protect our rights and property and those of others (e.g., if we detect misuse of our Service or otherwise detect unusual activity on your account or in your interactions with us); and

• for litigation or regulatory matters (e.g., we would retain your information if there was an ongoing legal claim and the information was relevant to the claim).

#### 8\. Links to other websites and social media features

Our Service may contain hyperlinks to websites or plugins of social media platforms that are not operated by us. These hyperlinks and plugins are provided for your reference and convenience only. This Privacy Policy only applies to the personal information that we collect or which we receive as detailed in this Privacy Policy, and we cannot be responsible for personal information about you that is collected and stored by third parties.

Third party websites have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies, and you should read these carefully before you submit any personal information to these websites. We do not endorse or otherwise accept any responsibility or liability for the content of such third-party websites or third-party terms and conditions or policies.

#### 9\. Children's privacy

As noted in the [Terms of Service](https://x.ai/legal/terms-of-service), our Service is not directed at children or minors under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from them. While we have taken measures to limit undesirable training data and outputs, Grok could produce output that is not appropriate for all ages.

If you are a child under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use our Service. If we learn that we have inadvertently obtained personal information about a child under the age of 18 via our Service, or from any other source, then we will delete that information as soon as possible.

Please contact us at [privacy@x.ai](mailto:privacy@x.ai) if you are aware that we may have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 18.

Automated decision-making

xAI does not make decisions or take actions against individuals in ways that could have a legal or significant impact on them.

In addition, in relation to Grok's training, xAI does not process training data for the purposes of inferring or deriving any sensitive or special category data about individuals and we do not actively seek out data sources that include sensitive or special category data.

International transfers

By using our Service, you understand and acknowledge that your personal information will be used, stored and/or accessed by us in the United States and disclosed to our service providers in other jurisdictions. We maintain primary data centers in the United States. We take steps designed to ensure that the personal information we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed as described in this Policy and according to applicable law.

When we provide any personal information about you to any non-UK and non-EEA third-party, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures may include the following:

* Ensuring that there is an adequacy decision by the UK Government in the case of transfers out of the UK, or by the European Commission in the case of transfers out of the EEA, which means that the recipient country is deemed to provide adequate protection for such personal information; or
    
* Having in place standard contractual clauses with the recipient which have been approved by the UK Government for transfers out of the UK or by European Commission for transfers outside the EEA.
    

Further details on the steps we take to protect your personal information, in these cases, are available up on request by contacting us by email at privacy@x.ai at any time.

Your rights

* You may access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions.

Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Output from our models. If Output contain factually inaccurate personal information relating to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make every effort to correct this information — but due to the technical complexity of our models, it may not always be possible for us to do so.

* You can object to processing of your personal information when our processing is based on our legitimate interests, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information, (i.e., your data to be transferred in a readable and standardized format).

Please note you can opt-out of our use of your information to train our models by contacting us at privacy@x.ai.

* If we send you any marketing communications, you have the right to opt-out of marketing communications at any time. We may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your Grok access or our ongoing business relations.
    
* If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
    
* You have the right to complain to a supervisory authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local supervisory authority. Contact details for supervisory authorities in the EEA and the UK are available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm). Certain supervisory authorities may require that you exhaust our own internal complaints process before looking into your complaint.
    

If you have an xAI account to access the Service, some of these rights may be exercised through your account. You can also exercise your rights by contacting us at [privacy@x.ai](mailto:privacy@x.ai). We will consider all such requests and provide our response in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Please note, however, that your personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, for example if we need to keep using your information to comply with our own legal obligations or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If an exception applies, we will inform you when responding to your request. We may request that you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.

Your rights

In addition to the rights detailed above in Sections 10 and 11 (e.g., your right to access, correct, or update your personal information), depending on what U.S. privacy law applies to you and subject to certain exceptions, you may also have the following rights:
