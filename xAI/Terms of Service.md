**Who we are**

Third-party services and software. Our Service may include or be integrated with third-party software, products, or services that are subject to their own terms. Our software may include open source software that is governed by its own licenses.

Downloadable software. Our Service may allow you to download software, such as mobile applications, which may update automatically to ensure you are using the latest version.

**Content**
-----------

Your content. You may provide input to the Service (”Input”) and receive output from the Service based on the Input (”Output”). Collectively, Input and Output are “Content.” You are responsible for Content, including ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions needed to provide Input to our Service.

Ownership of Content. To the extent permitted by applicable law and as between you and xAI: you retain your ownership rights to the Input, and you own the Output.

Our use of Content. You grant, an irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, and worldwide right to xAI to use, copy, store, modify, distribute, reproduce, publish, list information regarding, make derivative works of, and display your Content): (i) to maintain and provide the Service; (ii) to improve our products and the Service and for our other business purposes, such as data analysis, customer and market research, developing new products or features, and identifying usage trends; and (iii) to perform such other actions to enforce these Terms, comply with our Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, keep our Service safe, or as authorized by you in connection with your use of the Service. For safety and compliance purposes, Temporary Chat Content and Content that you request to be deleted is maintained on our backend systems for up to 30 days before deletion.

Accuracy. Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and is probabilistic in nature; it may therefore sometimes result in Output that contains “hallucinations,” may be offensive, may not accurately reflect real people, places or facts, may be objectionable, inappropriate, or otherwise not be suitable for your intended purpose.

Similarity of content. Due to the nature of artificial intelligence, outputs may not be unique and users may receive similar output from our Service. Your rights to Output does not extend to other’s rights.

Sharing of Content. Certain features of the Service may allow you to share Input and Output with others, including through your social networks or other third-party services, such as X. If you share Input or Output from the Service with others, you authorize xAI to share those materials with the applicable third-party. Please review the policies of any third-party service providers you share Input or Output with or through for additional information about how they may use those materials.

Opt out of training. If you do not want us to use your Content to train our models and improve our services, you can go to your account settings to opt out.

When you use our Service, you understand and agree that:

* Output may not always be accurate. Output from our services is not professional advice. You should conduct your own thorough research and should not rely on Output as the truth.
* You are responsible for evaluating the Output for accuracy and appropriateness for your use, including using human review and supervision, before using or sharing Output.
* Our Service may provide incomplete, incorrect, or offensive Output that does not represent xAI’s views. Outputs are not meant to endorse a person or third-party’s views.

**Beta technologies**
---------------------

We continue to add features to our Service, many in beta testing, which you accept “AS IS.”

We may implement rate limitations to accommodate system resources or usage needs.

“Temporary Chat” is beta technology where your conversation will not appear in your conversation history, and is removed from our system in about 30 days.

“Unhinged Mode” is a beta technology where the responses Grok provides are intended to be objectionable, inappropriate, and offensive, much like an amateur stand-up comic who is still learning the craft. You are not permitted to use “Unhinged Mode,” where available, unless you agree to interact with such material.

We may, where available, allow users to access Grok without logging in. When doing so, you agree that we will use any data you provide to or obtain from Grok for model training purposes, as further detailed in the Privacy Policy. Also, we may limit the number of requests you may send or responses you may receive from Grok. If you do not agree to these additional terms, you may not access or use Grok without logging in.

Grok conversation history from your X account. You may share your Grok conversation history from when you accessed Grok from your X account to the Grok mobile app or [grok.com](http://grok.com/) website by opting in when you sign into your xAI account using your X account credentials. You remain responsible for your use and activities on X, and xAI does not assume any of those responsibilities.

**Dispute resolution**
----------------------

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

You and xAI agree to the following mandatory arbitration and class action waiver provisions:

MANDATORY ARBITRATION. You and xAI agree to resolve any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Service, regardless of when the claim arose, even if it was before these Terms existed (a “Claim”), through final and binding arbitration. You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of account creation or of any updates to these arbitration terms within 30 days after the update has taken effect by emailing us at [legal@x.ai](mailto:legal@x.ai) with your full, legal name and stating your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of an update, the last set of agreed upon arbitration terms will apply. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.

Dispute-Resolution Process. For any Claim, you will first contact us at [legal@x.ai](mailto:legal@x.ai) and meet and confer to attempt to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve such Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. AAA may be contacted at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitration will be conducted by videoconference, unless the Arbitrator determines it must be in person, in which case it will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live (if applicable) or Palo Alto, California, unless you and xAI agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing and administrative fees and Arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this would not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are, or whether any provision of these Terms is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.

Exceptions. This section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Service or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.

CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS. BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND XAI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. THE FOREGOING APPLIES TO ALL USERS (BOTH NATURAL PERSONS AND ENTITIES), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES. THIS CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS. YOU AND XAI AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.

Governing Law. These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.

Severability. If any part of these arbitration terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class arbitration, class action, or representative action, this entire dispute resolution section will be unenforceable in its entirety.

**General Provisions**
----------------------

Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without our prior express written consent, but may be assigned by us without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof will be null and void.

Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms. We may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by applicable law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice or written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on the Service, as we determine, at our sole discretion. When we change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the ‘Effective’ date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any change to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any part of these Terms or to any future Terms of Service, do not access or use (or continue to access or use) the Service.

Entire Agreement; Severability. These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional written agreements you may enter into with us in connection with the Service, will constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the Service. Any statements or comments made between you and any of our employees or representatives are expressly excluded from these Terms and will not apply to you or us, or to your access to or use of the Service. Except as otherwise stated in the Arbitration Agreement, if any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect.

No Waiver. No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or of any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

California Residents. The provider of the Service is set forth herein. If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting it in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (916) 445-1254.

We are not obliged to participate in online dispute resolution and have chosen not to do so.

Limitation of Liability. The limitation of liability provided for in Section 13 does not apply to EU/UK-Consumers; instead, the following limitation of liability applies: xAI's liability to you for damages caused by mere negligence, irrespective of its legal ground, shall be limited as follows: (a)  for any breach of a material contractual obligation, xAI will be liable up to the amount of foreseeable damages typically occurring for this type of contract; and (b) for a breach of any non-material contractual obligations nor for the merely negligent breach of any other applicable duty of care xAI will not be liable. The aforementioned limitations of liability, as well as any other limitations of liability contained in these Terms, will not apply to any mandatory statutory obligation, in particular to statutory obligation under applicable product liability laws, and any liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence. Additionally, such limitations of liability will not apply if and to the extent that xAI has made a specific guarantee. The foregoing exclusions and limitations of liability shall also apply to the same extent in favor of xAI's executive bodies, legal representatives, employees and vicarious agents.

Information regarding Warranty and Compatibility/interoperability. Section 13 is not applicable to EU/UK-Consumers. The Service, as a digital product, is subject to a statutory warranty for defects. xAI will inform and supply you with updates that are necessary to keep the Service in conformity during the relevant contractual term.

No Release; Indemnity. The release according to Section 10 and the indemnity obligations according to Section 11 of the Terms shall not be applicable to EU/UK-Consumers subject to these EU/UK-Specific Terms.

Changes to the Terms and the EU/UK-Specific Terms. Contrary to Section 17(2), with respect to EU/UK-Consumers, xAI may unilaterally make changes to these Terms (including the EU/UK-Specific Terms) only when it is necessary to do so, particularly as a result of changes of law or to ensure a better functionality of the Service. xAI shall take proportionate measures to notify Users of such changes to the Terms and when the changes will take effect on our websites and in our Apps. xAI will provide this notice at least 14 calendar days prior to the date on which the changes will take effect. However, if the change is particularly significant, xAI shall notify you of the changes at least one month in advance. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you may object and must discontinue your use of the Service. If you do not object and continue to use the Service, you will be deemed to have acknowledged the amendment and agreed to be bound by it.
